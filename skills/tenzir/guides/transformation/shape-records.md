Records (objects) contain key-value pairs. This guide shows you how to work with records - accessing fields, extracting keys, combining fragments, and transforming values.

## Access record fields

Get values using dot notation or brackets:

```tql
from {
  user: {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 30,
    address: {
      city: "NYC",
      zip: "10001"
    }
  }
}
name = user.name
city = user.address.city
zip = user["address"]["zip"]
has_email = user.has("email")
```

```tql
{
  user: {
    name: "Alice",
    age: 30,
    address: {city: "NYC", zip: "10001"}
  },
  name: "Alice",
  city: "NYC",
  zip: "10001",
  has_email: false
}
```

## Get keys and values

Extract field names and values:

```tql
from {
  config: {
    host: "localhost",
    port: 8080,
    ssl: true
  }
}
field_names = config.keys()
// Note: values() function is not available
num_fields = config.keys().length()
```

```tql
{
  config: {host: "localhost", port: 8080, ssl: true},
  field_names: ["host", "port", "ssl"],
  num_fields: 3
}
```

## Combine records with spread

Use the spread operator `...` to combine records. Spread keeps the resulting record visible where you construct it, and lets you mix existing fragments with literals or computed fields. Later fields overwrite earlier fields, so put defaults first and overrides last:

```tql
from {
  defaults: {host: "localhost", port: 80, ssl: false},
  custom: {port: 8080, ssl: true}
}
service = {
  ...defaults,
  ...custom,
  debug: true,
}
```

```tql
{
  defaults: {host: "localhost", port: 80, ssl: false},
  custom: {port: 8080, ssl: true},
  service: {
    host: "localhost",
    port: 8080,
    ssl: true,
    debug: true
  }
}
```

Use optional access when a record fragment may be missing. If the spread expression evaluates to `null`, it contributes no fields, so an explicit `else {}` fallback is not necessary:

```tql
from {account: {id: 1, name: "Alice"}}
user = {
  ...account,
  ...account.profile?,
  active: true,
}
```

```tql
{
  account: {
    id: 1,
    name: "Alice",
  },
  user: {
    id: 1,
    name: "Alice",
    active: true,
  },
}
```

The [`merge`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/functions/merge.md) function returns the same result for two records, including `null` fragments, but prefer spread in transformation code when you construct the resulting record.

## Transform record values

Note: The `map_values` function is not available in TQL. To transform record values, you would need to reconstruct the record with transformed values manually:

```tql
from {
  prices: {
    apple: 1.50,
    banana: 0.75,
    orange: 2.00
  }
}
// Manual transformation example:
with_tax = {
  apple: prices.apple * 1.1,
  banana: prices.banana * 1.1,
  orange: prices.orange * 1.1
}
```

## Filter record fields

Keep explicit fields by constructing a new record. Use [`select_matching`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/functions/select_matching.md) and [`drop_matching`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/functions/drop_matching.md) when field names follow a pattern:

```tql
from {
  user: {
    id: 123,
    name: "Alice",
    email: "alice@example.com",
    password: "secret",
    api_key: "xyz123"
  }
}
public_info = {
  id: user.id,
  name: user.name,
  email: user.email
}
contact = {
  name: user.name,
  email: user.email
}
credentials = user.select_matching("(password|api_key)$")
safe_user = user.drop_matching("(password|api_key)$")
```

```tql
{
  user: {
    id: 123,
    name: "Alice",
    email: "alice@example.com",
    password: "secret",
    api_key: "xyz123"
  },
  public_info: {
    id: 123,
    name: "Alice",
    email: "alice@example.com"
  },
  contact: {
    name: "Alice",
    email: "alice@example.com"
  },
  credentials: {
    password: "secret",
    api_key: "xyz123"
  },
  safe_user: {
    id: 123,
    name: "Alice",
    email: "alice@example.com"
  }
}
```

The matching functions inspect only top-level field names on the record you call them on. They don’t recurse into nested records.
