# Configure project hooks

This guide shows you how to configure `tenzir-test` project hooks for setup and cleanup tasks that belong next to your tests. You’ll learn how to select local Tenzir binaries before discovery, set project-scoped environment variables, and collect artifacts from failed tests.

## Prerequisites

* A `tenzir-test` project with a `tests/` directory.
* Python code in the project can import `tenzir_test`.

## Choose a hook location

Create a `hooks/` package at the project root:

```sh
mkdir -p hooks
touch hooks/__init__.py
```

The harness also supports a single `hooks.py` file at the project root. Use one form per project and keep hooks at the project root. The harness doesn’t load hooks from nested directories such as `tests/foo/hooks/`.

## Select local Tenzir binaries before discovery

Use a `startup` hook when your project needs to choose `tenzir` and `tenzir-node` before the harness resolves executables. This is useful when you run tests against a local build instead of the binaries available on `PATH`.

Add the following hook to `hooks/__init__.py`:

```python
import subprocess
from pathlib import Path


from tenzir_test import hooks


@hooks.startup
def use_local_tenzir_build(ctx):
    # Use ctx.root to resolve paths from the invocation root.
    build_script = ctx.root / "scripts" / "build.sh"


    # Run helper commands with ctx.env so earlier hook changes apply.
    build_dir = Path(
        subprocess.check_output(
            [build_script, "--print-build-dir"],
            cwd=ctx.root,
            env=ctx.env,
            text=True,
        ).strip()
    )
    if not build_dir.is_absolute():
        build_dir = ctx.root / build_dir


    # ctx.path is a plain list that becomes PATH after the hook returns.
    bin_dir = build_dir / "bin"
    ctx.path.insert(0, str(bin_dir))


    # Mutate ctx.env for variables that tenzir-test should apply globally.
    ctx.env["TENZIR_BINARY"] = str(bin_dir / "tenzir")
    ctx.env["TENZIR_NODE_BINARY"] = str(bin_dir / "tenzir-node")


    # Use ctx.debug to emit optional diagnostics only in debug mode.
    if ctx.debug:
        print(f"using Tenzir binaries from {bin_dir}")
```

This example uses the `ctx` object to:

* Resolve project-local paths with `ctx.root`.
* Run a helper command with `subprocess.check_output()` and `ctx.env`.
* Update `PATH` by editing the plain `ctx.path` list.
* Set global environment variables through `ctx.env`.
* Print extra details only when `ctx.debug` is enabled.

Run the tests as usual:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test
```

The `startup` hook runs before settings and binary discovery. Changes to `ctx.env`, `ctx.path`, `TENZIR_BINARY`, and `TENZIR_NODE_BINARY` affect the whole invocation. To keep path handling predictable, edit `ctx.path` instead of `ctx.env["PATH"]`.

## Set environment variables for one project

Use `project_start` for environment values that should apply only to tests in the current project:

```python
from tenzir_test import hooks


@hooks.project_start
def configure_project(ctx):
    ctx.env["TENZIR_TEST_DATASET"] = ctx.project.root.name
```

The mapping in `ctx.env` and the list in `ctx.path` are project-scoped. Mutations apply to tests in that project and don’t leak into the next project in a multi-project run.

## Collect failed-test artifacts

Use `test_failure` to copy files from the per-test scratch directory before the harness removes it:

```python
import shutil


from tenzir_test import hooks


@hooks.test_failure
def save_failure_artifacts(ctx):
    if ctx.tmp_dir is None:
        return
    relative_test = ctx.test.relative_to(ctx.project.root).with_suffix("")
    target = ctx.project.root / ".tenzir-test-failures" / relative_test
    shutil.copytree(ctx.tmp_dir, target, dirs_exist_ok=True)
    print(f"saved failure artifacts to {target}")
```

This hook runs after `test_finish` and only for final failures. It doesn’t run for intermediate retry attempts.

## Understand hook ordering

For multi-project runs, root hooks wrap satellite hooks:

* Start events run from outer to inner: root, then satellite.
* Finish and failure events run from inner to outer: satellite, then root.

For a satellite test, the order is:

```text
root.project_start
satellite.project_start
root.test_start
satellite.test_start
run test
satellite.test_finish
root.test_finish
satellite.test_failure  # failed tests only
root.test_failure       # failed tests only
satellite.project_finish
root.project_finish
```

A root invocation runs only the root `startup` hook, even when it selects satellites. A satellite `startup` hook runs only when that satellite is the invocation root.

## Disable hooks during recovery

If a hook prevents the harness from starting, disable hooks for one invocation:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test --no-hooks
```

You can use the environment variable equivalent in scripts or CI:

```sh
TENZIR_TEST_DISABLE_HOOKS=1 uvx tenzir-test
```

## Next steps

* Use `shutdown` to emit final telemetry or clean up resources created during `startup`.
* Use `test_start` and `test_finish` to record per-test timing or status in an external system.
* Review the [test framework reference](../../reference/test-framework.md) for the full event list and CLI options.
