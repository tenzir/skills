This guide shows you how to make pipeline data available to external consumers by starting an HTTP server. You’ll learn how to stream serialized pipeline output to HTTP clients, pick a wire format, and configure connection limits and TLS.

## Spin up an HTTP server

Use [`serve_http`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/operators/serve_http.md) at the end of a pipeline to start an HTTP server. The nested pipeline chooses how to serialize your events:

```tql
from_file "example.yaml"
serve_http "0.0.0.0:8080" {
  write_ndjson
}
```

Any HTTP client connecting to `http://host:8080/` receives a continuous NDJSON stream. Each event is JSON-encoded on a single line, separated by newlines:

```bash
curl http://localhost:8080/
```

```json
{"timestamp":"2025-01-15T10:30:00Z","src_ip":"192.168.1.100","event":"login"}
{"timestamp":"2025-01-15T10:30:01Z","src_ip":"10.0.0.50","event":"file_access"}
```

Multiple clients can connect simultaneously. Each connected client receives a copy of the bytes produced after it connects.

### Choose a wire format

Use the nested pipeline to control the response body format and content type. For example, use [`write_lines`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/operators/write_lines.md) to stream plain text instead of NDJSON:

```tql
from_file "alerts.txt"
serve_http "0.0.0.0:8080" {
  write_lines
}
```

You can also add filters or transforms before the printer:

```tql
from_file "alerts.json"
where severity == "high"
serve_http "0.0.0.0:8080" {
  write_ndjson
}
```

### Understand delivery semantics

`serve_http` does not buffer output for future clients. A client only receives bytes produced after it connects.

If a client cannot keep up with the producer, Tenzir may disconnect it to keep memory usage bounded.

### Connection limits

Control the maximum number of simultaneous client connections:

```tql
from_file "data.csv"
serve_http "0.0.0.0:8080", max_connections=10 {
  write_ndjson
}
```

Additional clients wait until a connection slot becomes available.

### TLS encryption

Serve data over HTTPS by providing TLS certificates:

```tql
from_file "secret.json"
serve_http "0.0.0.0:8443",
  tls={
    certfile: "/path/to/cert.pem",
    keyfile: "/path/to/key.pem",
  } {
  write_ndjson
}
```
