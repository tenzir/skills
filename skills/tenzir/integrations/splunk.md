# Splunk integration

> Collect, index, and analyze machine-generated data for monitoring, searching, and troubleshooting.

[Splunk](https://splunk.com) is a SIEM solution for storing and processing logs. Tenzir can receive and send data through HEC and query Splunk searches.

## Examples

### Send data to an existing HEC endpoint

To send data from a pipeline to a Splunk [HTTP Event Collector (HEC)](https://docs.splunk.com/Documentation/Splunk/latest/Data/UsetheHTTPEventCollector) endpoint, use the [`to_splunk`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/operators/to_splunk.md) operator.

For example, deploy the following pipeline to forward [Suricata](suricata.md) alerts to Splunk:

```tql
subscribe "suricata"
where @name == "suricata.alert"
to_splunk "https://1.2.3.4:8088", hec_token="TOKEN", tls_no_verify=true
```

Replace `1.2.3.4` with the IP address of your Splunk host and `TOKEN` with your HEC token.

For more details, see the documentation for the [`to_splunk`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/operators/to_splunk.md) operator.

### Collect Splunk search results

Use [`from_splunk`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/operators/from_splunk.md) to run a bounded search through the Search Head management API and emit every result as an event:

```tql
from_splunk "https://splunk.example.com:8089",
  search="search index=main sourcetype=linux_secure",
  earliest="-15m",
  latest="-5m",
  headers={
    Authorization: secret("splunk-rest-authorization"),
  }
publish "splunk-results"
```

Tenzir initiates the connection to Splunk. Store the complete REST API authorization header value, such as `Bearer <authentication-token>`, `Splunk <session-key>`, or `Basic <base64-encoded-credentials>`, in the `splunk-rest-authorization` secret. A HEC token doesn’t authenticate search requests.

For recurring collection, wrap [`from_splunk`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/operators/from_splunk.md) in [`every`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/operators/every.md). Use explicit overlapping time windows when Splunk can index events late, and deduplicate repeated results downstream.

### Receive HEC events

Use [`accept_splunk`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/operators/accept_splunk.md) to receive HEC requests directly in a Tenzir pipeline:

```tql
accept_splunk hec_token=secret("splunk-hec-token")
publish "splunk"
```

The operator listens on the standard HEC port `8088`. Configure the same token in each exporter and disable indexer acknowledgements. Event requests retain their HEC envelope, while raw requests retain the complete body for downstream parsing.

For clients that still target port `9880`, set the listener explicitly:

```tql
accept_splunk "0.0.0.0:9880",
  hec_token=secret("splunk-hec-token")
publish "splunk"
```
