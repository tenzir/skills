# Amazon integration

> Stream events through MSK, store and replay them in S3, ship them to CloudWatch or Amazon Security Lake in OCSF, and pull messages from SQS, all with first-class IAM integration.

Tenzir runs natively on [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com) and connects to the AWS services security teams rely on every day. Stream events through managed Kafka, store and replay them in S3, ship them to CloudWatch or Amazon Security Lake in OCSF, and pull messages from SQS - all from the same pipeline language, using the AWS SDK directly and with first-class IAM integration.
