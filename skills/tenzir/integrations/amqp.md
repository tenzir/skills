# AMQP integration

> Send and receive messages between systems using a standardized, protocol-based approach.

The [Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)](https://www.amqp.org/) is an open standard for message-oriented middleware. It defines how producers, exchanges, queues, and consumers route messages between systems.

The diagram below shows the key abstractions and how they relate to a pipeline:

Tenzir supports sending and receiving messages via AMQP version 0-9-1.

When receiving messages, Tenzir emits each AMQP payload in the `message` field as a blob. Parse this field in the pipeline when the payload contains structured data.

## Examples

### Send events to an AMQP exchange

```tql
from {
  x: 42,
  y: "foo",
}
to_amqp "amqp://admin:pass@0.0.0.1:5672/vhost"
```

By default, `to_amqp` sends each input event as NDJSON. Use the `message` parameter to send a specific string or blob field instead.

### Receive events from an AMQP queue

```tql
from_amqp "amqp://admin:pass@0.0.0.1:5672/vhost", queue="events"
this = string(message).parse_json()
```
