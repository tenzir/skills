# Suricata integration

> Detect, log, and analyze network traffic for intrusion detection, prevention, and monitoring.

[Suricata](https://suricata.io/) is a network monitor with a rule matching engine to detect threats. Use Tenzir to acquire, process, and store Suricata logs.

## Examples

### Ingest EVE JSON logs into a node

[EVE JSON](https://docs.suricata.io/en/latest/output/eve/eve-json-output.html) is the log format in which Suricata generates events.

A typical Suricata configuration looks like this:

suricata.yaml

```yaml
outputs:
  # Extensible Event Format (nicknamed EVE) event log in JSON format
  - eve-log:
      enabled: yes
      filetype: regular #regular|syslog|unix_dgram|unix_stream|redis
      filename: eve.json
```

The `filetype` setting determines how you’d process the log file and defaults to `regular`.

Onboard Suricata EVE JSON logs via the [`read_suricata`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/operators/read_suricata.md) operator as follows:

```tql
from_file "/path/to/eve.json" {
  read_suricata
}
publish "suricata"
```

### Ingest EVE JSON from a Unix domain socket

Suricata can also send EVE JSON to a Unix stream socket:

suricata.yaml

```yaml
outputs:
  - eve-log:
      enabled: yes
      filetype: unix_stream
      filename: /run/suricata/eve.sock
```

Start Tenzir before Suricata so that Tenzir creates the socket and accepts the incoming stream:

```tql
accept_unix_socket "/run/suricata/eve.sock" {
  read_suricata
}
publish "suricata"
```

This is different from Suricata’s `unix-command` socket. The command socket is for JSON control commands, for example through `suricatasc`; it doesn’t carry EVE events.
