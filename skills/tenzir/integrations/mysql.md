# MySQL integration

> Connects to MySQL over the network using the MySQL wire protocol.

[MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/) is an open-source relational database management system widely used for web applications, data warehousing, and enterprise applications.

Tenzir connects to MySQL over the network using the MySQL wire protocol. Tenzir communicates with MySQL via the host and port you specify in the [`from_mysql`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/operators/from_mysql.md) operator. This means:

* **Network**: Tenzir and MySQL can run on the same machine (using `localhost`) or on different machines in the same network. You just need to make sure that Tenzir can reach the MySQL server.
* **IPC**: There is no direct inter-process communication (IPC) mechanism; all communication uses MySQL’s network protocol.
* **Co-deployment**: For best performance and security, deploy Tenzir and MySQL in the same trusted network or use TLS for encrypted connections.

## Examples

These examples assume that the MySQL server is running on the same host as Tenzir.

### List available tables

```tql
from_mysql show="tables", host="localhost", database="mydb"
```

### Execute a custom SQL query

```tql
from_mysql sql=r"SELECT id, name, email FROM users WHERE active = 1",
           host="localhost", database="mydb"
```

### Stream new rows

```tql
from_mysql table="events", live=true, host="localhost", database="mydb"
```
