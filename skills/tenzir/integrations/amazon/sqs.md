# Amazon SQS integration

> Send, receive, and manage messages between distributed applications.

[Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) is a managed message queue on AWS. It supports microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.

Tenzir can receive messages from SQS queues with [`from_amazon_sqs`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/operators/from_amazon_sqs.md) and send messages to SQS queues with [`to_amazon_sqs`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/operators/to_amazon_sqs.md).

When Tenzir reads from an SQS queue, it emits one event per SQS message. The event uses the `tenzir.sqs` schema and contains the message body in the `message` field together with SQS metadata such as the message ID, receive count, and send time.

By default, Tenzir deletes each received message from the queue after it emits the event. Set `keep_messages=true` to receive messages without deleting them. Combine it with `visibility_timeout` to control when SQS makes the messages visible again:

```tql
from_amazon_sqs "sqs://my-queue", keep_messages=true, visibility_timeout=30s
```

With `keep_messages=true`, SQS makes the message visible again after the queue’s visibility timeout. Use this when you want to inspect or replay messages. It doesn’t make downstream processing transactional.

The `poll_time` option configures [SQS long polling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-short-and-long-polling.html). Long polling waits for messages to arrive and reduces empty responses when the queue has no visible messages.

The `batch_size` option controls the maximum number of messages that SQS returns per receive request. SQS supports values from `1` to `10`.

## Queue identifiers

Pass a queue name, an `sqs://` URL, or a full SQS queue URL:

```tql
from_amazon_sqs "alerts"
from_amazon_sqs "sqs://alerts"
from_amazon_sqs "https://sqs.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/123456789012/alerts",
  aws_region="eu-west-1"
```

When you pass a queue name or an `sqs://` URL, Tenzir resolves the queue URL with `sqs:GetQueueUrl`. When you pass a full queue URL, Tenzir uses it directly. Set `aws_region` when the queue is outside the default AWS SDK region so request signing uses the correct region.

## Configuration

See [AWS Authentication](../../reference/aws-authentication.md) for the available AWS authentication mechanisms.

Use the `aws_iam` parameter to provide explicit credentials inline:

```tql
from_amazon_sqs "my-queue", aws_iam={
  region: "us-east-1",
  access_key_id: secret("aws-key"),
  secret_access_key: secret("aws-secret")
}
```

You can also use `aws_iam` to assume an IAM role:

```tql
from_amazon_sqs "my-queue", aws_iam={
  region: "eu-west-1",
  assume_role: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/my-sqs-role",
  session_name: "tenzir-session"
}
```

Tenzir needs these SQS permissions:

| Operator                                                                            | Required permissions                                         |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| [`from_amazon_sqs`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/operators/from_amazon_sqs.md) | `sqs:GetQueueUrl`, `sqs:ReceiveMessage`, `sqs:DeleteMessage` |
| [`to_amazon_sqs`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/operators/to_amazon_sqs.md)     | `sqs:GetQueueUrl`, `sqs:SendMessage`                         |

You don’t need `sqs:GetQueueUrl` when you pass a full queue URL. You also don’t need `sqs:DeleteMessage` for `from_amazon_sqs` pipelines that always use `keep_messages=true`.

## Examples

### Send a message to an SQS queue

```tql
from {foo: 42}
to_amazon_sqs "sqs://my-queue", message=this.print_json()
```

### Receive messages from an SQS queue

```tql
from_amazon_sqs "sqs://my-queue", poll_time=5s, batch_size=10
this = message.parse_json()
```

```tql
{foo: 42}
```

### Receive messages without deleting them

```tql
from_amazon_sqs "sqs://my-queue",
  keep_messages=true,
  poll_time=5s,
  batch_size=10,
  visibility_timeout=30s
this = message.parse_json()
```
