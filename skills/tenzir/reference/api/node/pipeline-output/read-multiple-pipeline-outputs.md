# Read multiple pipeline outputs

> post/serve-multi

post`/serve-multi`

Reads events from multiple existing pipeline output streams. By default, the endpoint uses long polling (`timeout: 5s`) and returns as soon as at least one event is available (`min_events: 1`).

Requires authentication`TenzirToken`

## Request body`application/json`

`requests``array<object>`required

Array items

`serve_id``string`required

The output stream identifier returned when the pipeline was launched.

`continuation_token``string`optional

The continuation token from the previous response for this output stream. Omit this field for the initial request.

`max_events``integer`optional

The maximum number of events to return across all requested output streams. The limit is split evenly across streams and rounded up when necessary.

Default`1024`

`min_events``integer`optional

The minimum number of events to wait for across all requested output streams before returning. The limit is split evenly across streams and rounded up when necessary.

Default`1`

`timeout``string`optional

The maximum time to spend on the request. Reaching the timeout returns the available events and is not an error. The timeout must not be greater than 10 seconds.

Default`5s`

`schema``enum`optional

The schema representation to include in each response. Use `exact` for a representation that matches Tenzir's type system exactly, and `never` to omit schema definitions.

Allowed values`legacy``exact``never`

Default`legacy`

Example

```json
{
  "requests": [
    {
      "serve_id": "query-1",
      "continuation_token": null
    },
    {
      "serve_id": "query-2",
      "continuation_token": "340ce2j"
    }
  ],
  "max_events": 1024,

  "schema": "exact"
}
```

## Responses

200The response contains one entry for each requested output stream.

Map values

`next_continuation_token``string | null`required

The token to use when reading the next batch. The value is `null` when the pipeline reached a terminal state.

`state``enum`required

The pipeline state at the time of the request.

Allowed values`running``completed``failed`
