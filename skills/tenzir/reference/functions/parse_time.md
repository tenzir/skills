# parse_time

> Parses a time from a string that follows a specific format.

Parses a time from a string that follows a specific format.

```tql
parse_time(input: string, format: string, [reference=time]) -> time
```

## Description

The `parse_time` function matches the given `input` string against the `format` to construct a timestamp.

### `input: string`

The input string from which the timestamp should be extracted.

### `format: string`

The string that specifies the format of `input`, for example `"%m-%d-%Y"`. The allowed format specifiers are the same as for `strptime(3)`:

| Specifier | Description                            | Example                   |

### `reference = time (optional)`

An optional timestamp that provides date context for formats whose year is missing. Parsed date fields win, and missing time fields don’t come from `reference`.

If the input contains a month and day but no year, `parse_time` chooses the year that places the parsed timestamp closest to the reference time.

If the input contains no date fields, `parse_time` chooses the date that places the parsed time of day closest to the reference time. Times shortly before or after midnight resolve to the adjacent day.

Other incomplete date formats, including dates built from week numbers such as `%G %V %u`, return null and emit a warning. ISO week fields next to a complete calendar date need no filling, so `parse_time` parses the date and ignores `reference`.

If `reference` is null and a date field is missing, `parse_time` returns null and emits a warning. If `format` includes a complete date, `parse_time` emits a warning that it ignored `reference`. If `format` doesn’t include a year and you don’t set `reference`, `parse_time` uses 1970 and emits a deprecation warning because this will become an error in a future release.

## Examples

### Parse a timestamp

```tql
from {
  x: "2024-12-31+12:59:42",
}
x = x.parse_time("%Y-%m-%d+%H:%M:%S")
```

```tql
{x: 2024-12-31T12:59:42.000000}
```

### Parse a BSD syslog timestamp

BSD syslog timestamps don’t include a year. Use `reference=now()` for live ingestion, or pass a fixed timestamp when you reprocess historic data.

```tql
from {
  timestamp: "May  5 18:16:21",
}
timestamp = timestamp.parse_time("%b %e %H:%M:%S", reference=now())
```

When you pass a fixed reference, the result is deterministic:

```tql
from {
  timestamp: "Dec 31 23:59:59",
}
timestamp = timestamp.parse_time(
  "%b %e %H:%M:%S",
  reference=2026-02-01T00:00:00Z,
)
```

```tql
{timestamp: 2025-12-31T23:59:59Z}
```

BSD syslog timestamps also don’t include a timezone. If you know the sender’s timezone, add the UTC offset to the string and parse it with `%z`:

```tql
from {
  bsd_time: "May  5 18:16:21",
}
timestamp = (bsd_time + " +0400").parse_time(
  "%b %e %H:%M:%S %z",
  reference=2026-05-05T00:00:00Z,
)
```

```tql
{timestamp: 2026-05-05T14:16:21Z}
```

### Parse a time without a date

Formats without date fields take their date from `reference`, choosing the day that places the time of day closest to it. Here the reference is two seconds past midnight, so the timestamp resolves to the previous day:

```tql
from {
  timestamp: "23:59:58",
}
timestamp = timestamp.parse_time(
  "%H:%M:%S",
  reference=2026-06-24T00:00:02Z,
)
```

```tql
{timestamp: 2026-06-23T23:59:58Z}
```
