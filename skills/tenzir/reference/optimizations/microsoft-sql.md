# Microsoft SQL Server

> When frommicrosoftsql reads a table, it lets SQL Server filter the rows, pick the columns, and stop after enough rows, so that SQL Server sends only what the pipeline needs instead of the whole table. This page describes when that happens, which filters SQL Server evaluates, and why the others stay in Tenzir. The optimizations overview explains how Tenzir optimizes pipelines in general and compares the databases.

When [`from_microsoft_sql`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/operators/from_microsoft_sql.md) reads a table, it lets SQL Server filter the rows, pick the columns, and stop after enough rows, so that SQL Server sends only what the pipeline needs instead of the whole table. This page describes when that happens, which filters SQL Server evaluates, and why the others stay in Tenzir. The [optimizations overview](../optimizations.md) explains how Tenzir optimizes pipelines in general and compares the databases.

## When it applies

The operator reads in one of these modes, and only table mode optimizes:

* **Table mode** reads a table that you name with `table`, as in `from_microsoft_sql table="dbo.alerts"`. The operator writes the query itself and adds the work of the operators that follow it. The rest of this page describes this mode.
* **SQL mode** sends the query that you write with `sql` or `query` exactly as written, and Tenzir applies the rest of the pipeline to its result. To have SQL Server filter, write the filter into your query.
* **Live mode**, with `live=true`, polls a table for new rows. Every poll carries the filters and the columns of table mode, but not the limit, since the limit counts rows across polls.

## How the query changes

The operator turns the operators that follow it into parts of its `SELECT`:

* [`where`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/operators/where.md) becomes a `WHERE` clause, as far as SQL Server evaluates the filter exactly like Tenzir.
* [`select`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/operators/select.md) narrows the selected columns to those that the pipeline reads.
* [`head`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/operators/head.md) becomes a `TOP`, if every filter before it went into the query.

For example, the pipeline

```tql
from_microsoft_sql table="dbo.alerts", host="db.example.com", database="soc"
where severity >= 3 and rule.starts_with("ET ")
select id, message
head 100
```

sends a query equivalent to

```sql
SELECT TOP (100) [id], [message], [severity], [rule]
FROM [dbo].[alerts]
WHERE [severity] >= 3
  AND LEFT(<hex of rule>, LEN('455420')) = '455420'
```

Here, `<hex of rule>` stands for the bytes of the `rule` column in hexadecimal, which the [text comparisons](microsoft-sql.md#text-comparisons) section explains. The [`where`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/operators/where.md), [`select`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/operators/select.md), and [`head`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/operators/head.md) operators still run in Tenzir on the rows that SQL Server returns, so the result is the same whether SQL Server evaluated a filter or not.

## Aggregation input columns

With final summary output, [`summarize`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/operators/summarize.md) also narrows the input columns, subject to the [selected-column rules](microsoft-sql.md#selected-columns). The [aggregation projection rules](../optimizations.md#aggregation-input-projections) apply to [`top`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/operators/top.md) and [`rare`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/operators/rare.md) as well. Aggregation still runs in Tenzir, not in a SQL `GROUP BY`; a [`head`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/operators/head.md) after it does not add an input `TOP`. Explicit `sql` and `query` arguments remain unchanged.

## Filters that SQL Server evaluates

The operator puts a filter into the query only if SQL Server evaluates it exactly like Tenzir. These filters qualify:

* Comparisons of a column with a literal of matching kind: numbers against `tinyint`, `smallint`, `int`, `bigint`, `real`, and `float` columns, strings against `char`, `varchar`, `nchar`, `nvarchar`, and `uniqueidentifier` columns, and `time` values against `date`, `datetime2`, `datetimeoffset`, and `smalldatetime` columns. Booleans compare with `bit` columns for equality only.
* Null checks with `== null` and `!= null`.
* Membership tests with `in` and a list of such literals.
* Comparisons between two columns of the same kind. Temporal columns must share their exact type, such as two `datetime2(3)` columns.
* Bare `bit` columns, such as `where active`, which go into the query as `[active] = 1`, since T-SQL has no boolean values.
* The string functions `starts_with`, `ends_with`, and `length_bytes`, and substring search with `"needle" in haystack`.
* Arithmetic that cannot overflow: `+`, `-`, and `*` on integer columns of at most 32 bits with a literal whose magnitude is below 2^31, and any `+`, `-`, `*`, or `/` that yields a floating-point number, except division by zero. SQL Server computes in the types of the operands, so the query widens the column first: `n + 1 > 5` becomes `CAST(n AS bigint) + 1 > 5`.
* Expressions that consist of literals only, such as `2024-01-01 + 1d`, which are computed ahead of time.
* The boolean operators `and`, `or`, and `not`.
* An `ip` literal compared with a text column, which compares as the canonical text of the address.

Time literals take the column’s own type and are spelled in ISO 8601, so a comparison does not depend on the session’s language or date format, and a `datetimeoffset` compares as an instant, whatever its offset. A `time` literal that falls between two values of a coarser column, such as `2024-01-01T12:00:00` against a `date` column, resolves to the neighboring value for orderings and to `false` for equality.

A limit goes into the query as `TOP (n)` up to 9,223,372,036,854,775,807, the largest `bigint`. A larger limit is enforced in Tenzir.

## Text comparisons

SQL Server compares text under the collation of the column, and the default collations ignore case and accents. In addition, every comparison pads the shorter operand, even under a binary collation: `N'a' = N'a '` holds, and so does `N'a' + NCHAR(9) < N'a'`, which sorts a tab after the padding space. Binary values pad with zero bytes, so `0x61 = 0x6100` holds, too.

The operator therefore compares text by the hexadecimal spelling of the bytes that Tenzir sees: the stored bytes of `char` and `varchar`, the UTF-8 encoding of `nchar` and `nvarchar`, and the lowercase text of a `uniqueidentifier`. Every hexadecimal digit sorts after the padding space, so comparisons of these spellings, `IN`, `LEFT`, and `RIGHT` compare bytes exactly like TQL. SQL Server cannot use an index on such a column for the comparison, but it still saves transferring the rows that the predicate drops.

Converting `nchar` and `nvarchar` to UTF-8 needs the UTF-8 collations of SQL Server 2019 and Azure SQL. On older servers, predicates on these columns run in Tenzir.

## Filters that stay in Tenzir

Everything else runs in Tenzir, with the same result. This includes:

* Comparisons on `decimal`, `numeric`, `money`, and `smallmoney` columns, which SQL Server compares exactly, while Tenzir sees the nearest `double`.
* Comparisons on `datetime` columns, whose ticks of 1/300 second Tenzir rounds to milliseconds, and on `time` columns, which Tenzir reads as `duration`.
* `text`, `ntext`, `xml`, `binary`, `varbinary`, and `image` columns.
* Hidden columns, which `SELECT *` leaves out, so that Tenzir never sees them.
* Case-insensitive matching with `ignore_case=true`, and regular expressions, which T-SQL does not have.
* Arithmetic on `bigint` columns or between two columns.
* Subnet membership tests on text columns, such as `src in 10.0.0.0/8`.
* All other functions.

## Selected columns

Column names must match exactly, including their case: SQL Server finds a column regardless of case, but names the result column as the query spells it. When a predicate that runs in Tenzir calls a function, or the pipeline reads `this`, the operator selects every column. When the pipeline needs no column at all, it selects the first one, so that every row arrives. In live mode, the tracking column is always selected.
