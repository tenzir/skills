# from_nic

> Captures packets from a network interface and outputs events.

Captures packets from a network interface and outputs events.

```tql
from_nic iface:string, [snaplen=int, filter=string] { … }
```

## Description

The `from_nic` operator captures packets with libpcap and forwards them as events.

If you omit the optional pipeline, `from_nic` uses [`read_pcap`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/operators/read_pcap.md) by default. Provide a pipeline when you want to change how the captured PCAP byte stream is parsed. The pipeline must accept bytes and return events.

Use `filter` to apply a Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) expression before Tenzir parses packets. This lets libpcap drop unwanted traffic early.

### `iface: string`

The interface to capture packets from.

### `snaplen = int (optional)`

Sets the snapshot length of captured packets.

This value is an upper bound on the packet size. Packets larger than this size get truncated to `snaplen` bytes.

Defaults to `262144`.

### `filter = string (optional)`

Applies a Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) expression to the capture.

The filter runs in libpcap before Tenzir parses packets. Use the same filter syntax as `tcpdump`, for example `tcp port 443` or `host 10.0.0.1`.

### `{ … } (optional)`

An optional parsing pipeline for the captured PCAP byte stream.

When omitted, `from_nic` defaults to:

```tql
{ read_pcap }
```

Provide a custom pipeline when you want to adjust parsing behavior, for example to re-emit PCAP file headers.

## Examples

### Capture packets from `en1`

```tql
from_nic "en1"
```

### Capture packets and re-emit file headers

```tql
from_nic "en1" {
  read_pcap emit_file_headers=true
}
```

### Capture only HTTPS traffic

```tql
from_nic "en1", filter="tcp port 443"
```

### Write a live capture to a PCAP file

```tql
from_nic "en1"
to_file "trace.pcap" {
  write_pcap
}
```
