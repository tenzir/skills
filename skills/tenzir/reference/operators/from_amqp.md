Receives messages from an AMQP queue.

```tql
from_amqp url:secret, [channel=int, exchange=str, routing_key=str, queue=str,
                       options=record, queue_arguments=record, passive=bool,
                       durable=bool, exclusive=bool, no_auto_delete=bool,
                       no_local=bool, ack=bool]
```

## Description

The `from_amqp` operator is an [AMQP](https://www.amqp.org/) 0-9-1 client that receives messages from a queue. It emits one event per AMQP message with the schema `tenzir.amqp` and a `message: blob` field containing the message body.

### `url: secret`

The URL of the AMQP server. The URL must have the following format:

```txt
amqp://[USERNAME[:PASSWORD]@]HOSTNAME[:PORT]/[VHOST]
```

The URL is required. Values in the URL override corresponding entries from `options`.

### `channel = int (optional)`

The channel number to use.

The value must fit into an unsigned 16-bit integer.

Defaults to `1`.

### `exchange = str (optional)`

The exchange to interact with.

Defaults to `"amq.direct"`.

### `routing_key = str (optional)`

The routing key to bind the queue to the exchange.

Defaults to the empty string.

### `queue = str (optional)`

The name of the queue to declare and bind.

Defaults to the empty string, which lets the broker generate a queue name, such as `"amq.gen-XNTLF0FwabIn9FFKKtQHzg"`.

### `options = record (optional)`

An option record for the AMQP connection. Values must be numbers, booleans, strings, or secrets.

Use `options` to configure the AMQP connection. Use `queue_arguments` to configure the queue declaration.

Available options are:

```yaml
hostname: 127.0.0.1
port: 5672
ssl: false
vhost: /
max_channels: 2047
frame_size: 131072
heartbeat: 0
sasl_method: plain
username: guest
password: guest
```

### `queue_arguments = record (optional)`

A record of AMQP field-table arguments to pass to the queue declaration.

Use this parameter for broker-specific queue settings, such as RabbitMQ quorum queues, queue length limits, message TTLs, single active consumers, and dead-lettering settings.

Values must be numbers, booleans, or strings. Nested records, lists, blobs, nulls, and secrets are not supported.

### `passive = bool (optional)`

If `true`, the broker replies with OK if a queue already exists with the same name and raises an error otherwise.

Defaults to `false`.

### `durable = bool (optional)`

If `true`, a newly created queue is durable and remains active when the broker restarts.

Defaults to `false`.

### `exclusive = bool (optional)`

If `true`, the queue is exclusive to the current connection and is deleted when the connection closes.

Defaults to `false`.

### `no_auto_delete = bool (optional)`

If `true`, the queue is not deleted when all consumers have finished using it.

Defaults to `false`.

### `no_local = bool (optional)`

If `true`, the broker doesn’t send messages to the connection that published them.

Defaults to `false`.

### `ack = bool (optional)`

If `true`, the broker expects acknowledgements for messages. If `false`, the broker assumes delivery will succeed and immediately dequeues the message.

Defaults to `false`.

## Examples

### Receive messages from an AMQP queue

```tql
from_amqp "amqp://admin:pass@0.0.0.1:5672/vhost", queue="events"
```

### Parse JSON messages

```tql
from_amqp "amqp://admin:pass@0.0.0.1:5672/vhost", queue="events"
this = string(message).parse_json()
```

### Configure connection options

```tql
from_amqp "amqp://broker/vhost", options={
  username: "tenzir",
  password: secret("amqp-password"),
  heartbeat: 30,
}
```

### Declare a RabbitMQ quorum queue

```tql
from_amqp "amqp://broker/vhost",
          queue="events",
          durable=true,
          no_auto_delete=true,
          queue_arguments={
            "x-queue-type": "quorum",
            "x-quorum-initial-group-size": 1,
          }
```
