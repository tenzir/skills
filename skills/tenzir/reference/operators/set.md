# set

> Assigns a value to a field, creating it if necessary.

Assigns a value to a field, creating it if necessary.

```tql
field = expr
set field=expr...
```

## Description

Assigns a value to a field, creating it if necessary. If the field does not exist, it is appended to the end. If the field name is a path such as `foo.bar.baz`, records for `foo` and `bar` will be created if they do not exist yet. Use brackets to compute a path segment at runtime, as in `foo[key] = value`. The index expression must return a string. Otherwise, Tenzir emits a warning and skips the assignment for that event.

Within assignments, the `move` keyword in front of a field causes a field to be removed from the input after evaluation.

Implied operator

The `set` operator is implied whenever a direct assignment is written. We recommend to use the implicit version. For example, use `test = 42` instead of `set test=42`.

Read our [language documentation](../statements.md#assignment) for a more detailed description.

## Examples

### Append a new field

```tql
from {a: 1, b: 2}
c = a + b
```

```tql
{a: 1, b: 2, c: 3}
```

### Update an existing field

```tql
from {a: 1, b: 2}
a = "Hello"
```

```tql
{a: "Hello", b: 2}
```

### Compute a field name

```tql
from {key: "latency", value: 42}
metrics[key] = value
```

```tql
{
  key: "latency",
  value: 42,
  metrics: {
    latency: 42,
  },
}
```

### Move a field

```tql
from {a: 1}
b = move a
```

```tql
{b: 1}
```
