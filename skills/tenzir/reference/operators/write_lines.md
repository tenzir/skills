> Writes events as key-value pairsthe values of an event.

Writes events as key-value pairsthe *values* of an event.

```tql
write_lines
```

Tip

Use [`write_kv`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/operators/write_kv.md) operator if you also want to write the *key*s.

## Description

Each event is printed on a new line, with fields separated by spaces, and nulls skipped.

Note

The lines printer does not perform any escaping. Characters like `\n` and `"` are printed as is.

## Examples

### Write the values of an event

```tql
from {x:1, y:true, z: "String"}
write_lines
```

```txt
1 true String
```
