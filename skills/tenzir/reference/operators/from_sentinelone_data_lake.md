Queries SentinelOne Singularity Data Lake with TQL.

```tql
from_sentinelone_data_lake url:string, token=string,
                           [query=string, start=time, end=time,
                            account_ids=list<string>, timeout=duration, raw=bool]
```

## Description

The `from_sentinelone_data_lake` operator builds a remote query from your TQL filters, timestamp bounds, and limits. You don’t need to write PowerQuery or pass `query`, `start`, or `end`:

```tql
let $end = now()
from_sentinelone_data_lake "https://<tenant>.sentinelone.net",
  token=secret("sentinelone-console-token")
where timestamp >= $end - 1h and timestamp < $end
where severity > 3 and message.starts_with("alert")
head 100
```

Bind relative times with `let` so the optimizer receives fixed timestamps. The operator checks the assembled query when it starts. Without an explicit `query`, at least one supported filter, inferred time bound, pushable limit, or explicit `start` or `end` must constrain the request. Otherwise it reports an error before contacting SentinelOne. For example, a bare source or an unsupported regex filter followed by `head` cannot supply the necessary query. Supported constraints can still run remotely when other predicates stay local.

Exploratory pipelines retrieve complete parsed events, including fields that neither the filter nor the rest of the pipeline names. A restrictive `select` can instead use projected PowerQuery to transfer fewer fields. The operator chooses automatically; you do not need a retrieval flag. Whole-event inspection, dynamic field access, and whole-record selections use complete-event retrieval when a finite PQ column list cannot represent them safely.

You can provide `query` as an escape hatch for native PowerQuery. The operator uses SentinelOne’s Long Running Query (LRQ) API on your tenant’s console host: it launches queries at `/sdl/v2/api/queries`, polls once per second, and reads completed results. Generated reads can use LOG search with cursor continuation or projected PQ. Explicit native queries always remain PQ. Each completed server-side query is deleted before its events are emitted, including when a downstream operator stops after the first event.

When you omit `query`, timestamp predicates supply missing time bounds. For a request that satisfies the constraint requirement, any remaining missing bound defaults: `end` to the current time and `start` to 24 hours before `end`. The default time window does not itself satisfy that requirement: a bare source still errors before contacting SentinelOne. The operator sends both time bounds explicitly and requests low query priority.

It retries rate-limited launches and transient HTTP or connection errors during polling, up to five attempts, and honors `Retry-After`. It does not retry a launch after a connection error or an ambiguous HTTP `5xx` response because the server may already have created the query. Launch retries wait for `Retry-After` within the operator’s total `timeout` budget. During polling, if the requested delay would exceed the active query’s keep-alive budget, the operator stops instead of retrying early. Invalid `Retry-After` headers, including delays outside the supported numeric range, fail the query rather than trigger a shorter fallback delay.

Migration from the V1 API

Replace regional URLs such as `https://xdr.eu1.sentinelone.net` with your console URL, `https://<tenant>.sentinelone.net`. Replace scoped SDL Log Read keys with a console service-user API token. There is no fallback to `/api/powerQuery`, which SentinelOne retires on February 15, 2027.

### `url: string`

The base URL of your tenant’s SentinelOne console, for example `https://<tenant>.sentinelone.net`.

Use HTTPS for your console. Regional `xdr.*.sentinelone.net` URLs are no longer supported.

### `token = string`

A console service-user API token. The operator sends it with Bearer authentication, not the `ApiToken` prefix used by the management API.

Use the [`secret()`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/functions/secret.md) function to reference credentials securely.

### `query = string (optional)`

A native PowerQuery to use instead of constructing the query entirely from TQL. It must not be empty when provided. The operator sends this query and its time window unchanged. Downstream TQL filters and limits run locally so they cannot change the rows selected by SentinelOne’s result cap. Omit this argument for TQL-only queries.

For native queries, refer to the [SentinelOne PowerQuery documentation](https://support.sentinelone.com/hc/en-us/articles/360004195934).

### `start = time (optional)`

The start time for the query time range.

Events at or after this time are included. When you omit `query`, a supported TQL timestamp predicate can supply this bound. Otherwise it defaults to 24 hours before `end`. An explicit value is a hard lower bound. When you omit `query`, TQL can narrow it but cannot widen it. Fractional seconds retain nanosecond precision.

### `end = time (optional)`

The end time for the query time range.

Events before this time are included. When you omit `query`, a supported TQL timestamp predicate can supply this bound. Otherwise it defaults to the current time when the operator starts. An explicit value is a hard upper bound.

### `account_ids = list<string> (optional)`

The account IDs to query. The list must not be empty.

When omitted, the operator requests tenant scope. On some multi-account tenants, that scope selects a default account that may not contain your data. If a query unexpectedly returns no rows, specify the account IDs containing the data. The operator sends `tenant: false` together with `accountIds` when you set this argument.

### `timeout = duration (optional)`

The total time budget for launching and polling queries, including all pages, retrieval fallbacks, and retry delays. Must be greater than zero. Defaults to `3min`.

When the budget expires, the operator attempts to delete the active server-side query and reports an error. Earlier pages may already have been emitted; that run is incomplete. Cleanup can take additional time. Increase this value for longer reads, for example `timeout=5min`, or narrow the search. Neither successful polls nor new pages reset the budget.

### `raw = bool (optional)`

Whether to skip parsing strings as typed data.

Defaults to `false`. Dotted attribute names still become nested records, and `timestamp` metadata remains a time value.

## Optimizations

When you omit `query`, the operator uses [`where`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/operators/where.md), [`select`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/operators/select.md), and [`head`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/operators/head.md) to narrow the search window, send safe prefilters, and choose between complete-event LOG retrieval and projected PQ. Every original predicate still runs locally, and `head` counts events after that filtering. A full PQ response or ambiguous projected values can trigger a LOG fallback before any PQ events are emitted. With an explicit `query`, both the query and its time window stay unchanged.

Our [SentinelOne optimization reference](../optimizations/sentinelone.md) describes which filters translate, how TQL maps to PowerQuery, which fields the operator requests, and how the result cap interacts with pushed filters.

## Limitations

* Explicit PowerQuery requests retain the default 1,000-row cap for queries without `limit` or `group`. Add `| limit N` to the native query to request a larger result. Generated TQL reads instead use [LOG continuation when needed](../optimizations/sentinelone.md#limits-and-the-result-cap).
* Output order is not guaranteed. LOG pages are separate queries, not a snapshot of a changing data lake.
* Generated reads retry explicitly incomplete PQ results through LOG and fail if LOG reports omissions. Unreported API-side omissions cannot be detected. Explicit native queries do not currently report those omission indicators.
* SentinelOne expires queries 30 seconds after the last poll and kills queries after five minutes. An expired or killed query fails with HTTP `404`; the operator does not relaunch it automatically.
* Graceful shutdown deletes an active query. Forced cancellation during polling relies on the server’s 30-second expiry. Checkpointing is not supported.

## Examples

### Query historical events with TQL

```tql
from_sentinelone_data_lake "https://<tenant>.sentinelone.net",
  token=secret("sentinelone-console-token")
where timestamp >= 2024-01-01 and timestamp < 2024-01-02
where severity > 3
select timestamp, message
head 100
```

### Use a native PowerQuery

```tql
from_sentinelone_data_lake "https://<tenant>.sentinelone.net",
  token=secret("sentinelone-console-token"),
  query="severity > 3 | columns id",
  account_ids=["1234567890123456789"],
  start=now()-10d,
  end=now()-3d
```
