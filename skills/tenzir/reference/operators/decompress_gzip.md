decompress_gzip

## Description

The `decompress_gzip` operator decompresses bytes in a pipeline incrementally. The operator supports decompressing multiple concatenated streams of the same codec transparently.

## Examples

### Import Suricata events from a Gzip-compressed file

```tql
from_file "eve.json.gz" {
  decompress_gzip
  read_suricata
}
import
```
