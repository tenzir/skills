Runs a Microsoft Defender advanced hunting query and reads its results.

```tql
from_microsoft_defender query:string, azure_auth=record, [start=time, end=time, tls=bool|record]
```

## Description

The `from_microsoft_defender` operator is a finite source that sends a `POST` request to Microsoft Graph [`/v1.0/security/runHuntingQuery`](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/api/security-security-runhuntingquery?view=graph-rest-1.0). It passes your Kusto Query Language (KQL) string unchanged and emits the returned rows, not the Graph response envelope. It doesn’t normalize events to OCSF.

The operator validates the entire response before emitting any rows. Empty results succeed without emitting events. Invalid schemas, incompatible values, service errors, and unexpected envelope fields (including partial-result or continuation metadata) fail the pipeline. Diagnostics omit response bodies and result values. HTTP failures and invalid responses include a request ID when the service provides a safe identifier. Query errors point to `query`, while authorization errors point to `azure_auth` and provide status-specific setup hints.

The operator uses the same Entra client-credentials token provider, TLS settings, and bounded HTTP retry policy as [`from_microsoft_graph`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/operators/from_microsoft_graph.md). Transient failures and throttling honor `Retry-After`; exhausted retries fail the pipeline. The operator checks token freshness before each attempt and refreshes it when needed, including after a retry delay. Retries preserve the original query and explicit time range. Permanent client and authorization failures aren’t retried.

There is no pagination, automatic time-window splitting, persistent cursor, or deduplication guarantee. Restarting the pipeline reruns the query. The Graph v1.0 endpoint and result-type references don’t specify numeric result limits or a success-response truncation indicator. Don’t apply limits from the older Defender hunting API or the interactive portal to this endpoint. A successful response is **not a guarantee of extraction completeness**. Bound queries with appropriate time predicates and projections, and check your tenant’s service quotas and data availability.

### Result types

Column names and capitalization are preserved. The response schema controls conversion:

| Defender type            | Tenzir type                                                  |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `DateTime`               | `time`                                                       |
| `Int32`, `Int64`, `Long` | `int64`                                                      |
| `Double`, `Real`         | `double`                                                     |
| `Boolean`, `Bool`        | `bool`                                                       |
| `String`, `Guid`         | `string`                                                     |
| `Dynamic`                | Records, lists, or scalar values according to the JSON value |

KQL spellings such as `datetime`, `long`, `real`, and `dynamic` are also accepted. Null values remain null. Integers must fit signed 64-bit range and aren’t converted through floating point. Ordinary string columns stay strings even when they look like timestamps, IP addresses, numbers, or durations. Dynamic values can be native JSON or JSON serialized into a string. A dynamic string that contains valid JSON is decoded, so `"42"`, `"true"`, and `"null"` become a number, a boolean, and null. Nested strings don’t undergo timestamp or IP inference. Heterogeneous lists follow Tenzir’s list representation, which may stringify incompatible element types.

### `query: string`

The required, arbitrary KQL query. You can select tables, filter events, join available tables, aggregate, and project computed columns. Tenzir doesn’t rewrite the query or push downstream filters into it.

### `azure_auth = record`

Required Microsoft Entra application credentials:

| Field           | Type                 | Description                                                   |
| --------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tenant_id`     | `string` or `secret` | Tenant ID or domain.                                          |
| `client_id`     | `string` or `secret` | Application client ID.                                        |
| `client_secret` | `string` or `secret` | Application client secret.                                    |
| `scope`         | `string` or `secret` | Optional; defaults to `https://graph.microsoft.com/.default`. |
| `authority`     | `string` or `secret` | Optional; defaults to `https://login.microsoftonline.com`.    |

The default endpoint and audience target Azure public cloud. Delegated tokens and web identity assertions aren’t supported.

To configure access:

1. Register an application in Microsoft Entra ID.
2. Add the Microsoft Graph **application** permission `ThreatHunting.Read.All`.
3. Grant tenant administrator consent.
4. Create a client secret and store it in your Tenzir secret store.
5. Confirm that your tenant has the Defender product licenses and table access needed by your specific query. API permission alone doesn’t provide licenses or make uncollected data available.

### `start = time`, `end = time` (optional)

Specify both arguments or neither. The start must be earlier than the end. The arguments are evaluated once for the operator invocation and sent as a single ISO 8601 `Timespan` interval. Retries reuse that interval. Tenzir doesn’t inject a `Timestamp` predicate into your KQL.

When you omit both arguments, the request omits `Timespan`. The Graph service currently documents a default lookback of 30 days. This isn’t a retention promise: availability depends on the table, retention configuration, licenses, and tenant. Time filters in the KQL query still apply; Microsoft documents that the shorter range applies when both the query and request constrain time.

### `tls = bool | record` (optional)

TLS configuration, with the same behavior as [`from_microsoft_graph`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/operators/from_microsoft_graph.md#tls--bool--record-optional). HTTPS and certificate verification are enabled by default.

## Examples

### Read native Defender events

```tql
from_microsoft_defender "DeviceProcessEvents | project Timestamp, DeviceName, FileName | take 100",
  azure_auth={
    tenant_id: secret("AZURE_TENANT_ID"),
    client_id: secret("AZURE_CLIENT_ID"),
    client_secret: secret("AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET"),
  }
```

### Query a bounded interval

```tql
from_microsoft_defender "DeviceEvents | summarize Count=count() by ActionType",
  azure_auth={
    tenant_id: secret("AZURE_TENANT_ID"),
    client_id: secret("AZURE_CLIENT_ID"),
    client_secret: secret("AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET"),
  },
  start=2026-01-01,
  end=2026-01-02
```

## Defender and Sentinel

Native Defender advanced hunting doesn’t require a Sentinel or Log Analytics workspace. It queries the Defender data available to your tenant and application. Copies ingested into a Log Analytics workspace are separate datasets with their own retention and ingestion configuration; they aren’t interchangeable with native Defender tables.

Microsoft also describes [advanced hunting with connected Sentinel data](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/defender-xdr/advanced-hunting-microsoft-defender). This operator doesn’t expose `workspace_id` or select a Sentinel workspace. Workspace targeting and acceptance testing against connected Sentinel are outside this version’s scope. Validate licensing, table access, and expected query results in your own tenant before relying on the pipeline in production.
