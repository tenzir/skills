  Answer questions using the Tenzir documentation. Use whenever the user asks
  about TQL syntax, pipeline operators, functions, data parsing or
  transformation, normalization, OCSF mapping, enrichment, lookup tables,
  contexts, packages, nodes, platform setup, deployment, configuration,
  integrations with tools like Splunk, Kafka, S3, Elasticsearch, or any other
  Tenzir feature. Also use when the user asks how to collect, route, filter,
  aggregate, or export security data with Tenzir, or needs help writing or
  debugging TQL pipelines, even if they don't mention 'Tenzir' explicitly but
  are clearly working in a Tenzir context. Also use for questions about
  Tenzir the company or product, release notes and changelog, blog posts,
  and solution use cases.

# Tenzir Documentation Map

> The security data pipeline platform.

## How to use this skill

Navigate the documentation based on the type of question:

| Question type | Where to look |
|---|---|
| "How do I…" tasks | [Guides](guides.md) — step-by-step instructions organized by task |
| Operator or function syntax | [Operator Index](reference/operators-index.md) or [Function Index](reference/functions-index.md), then the specific page |
| Integration setup (Splunk, Kafka, S3…) | [Integrations](#integrations) — per-product setup and pipeline examples |
| Concepts (nodes, pipelines, deployment) | [Explanations](explanations.md) — architecture and design |
| Learning from scratch | [Tutorials](tutorials.md) — guided lessons |
| TQL language rules | [Language](explanations/language.md), [Expressions](reference/expressions.md), [Statements](reference/statements.md) |

Always read the relevant page before answering. Prefer TQL examples from the
documentation over inventing syntax.

## Beyond the docs

This skill bundles only the documentation. For anything else about
Tenzir, fetch these live pages on demand instead of answering from
memory:

| Topic | Where to look |
|---|---|
| Release notes, "when was X added/changed" | <https://tenzir.com/changelog.md> |
| Blog posts and announcements | <https://tenzir.com/blog.md> |
| Solution use cases | <https://tenzir.com/solutions.md> |
| Company, product, events, everything else | <https://tenzir.com/llms.txt> — the full site index with per-page Markdown links |

## Answer patterns

**Operator syntax question** — *"How does `where` work?"*
→ Read [where](reference/operators/where.md), explain the syntax, show the doc's TQL examples.

**Integration question** — *"How do I send data to Splunk?"*
→ Read [Splunk](integrations/splunk.md), provide the pipeline example from the page.

**Task question** — *"How do I parse syslog?"*
→ Read [Parse delimited text](guides/parsing/parse-delimited-text.md) and
[read_syslog](reference/operators/read_syslog.md). Combine the guide's approach
with the operator reference.

This tutorial teaches you to write TQL that is clear, efficient, and maintainable.

### Development

## [Explanations](explanations.md)

Explanations are big-picture explanations of higher-level Tenzir concepts.

### Architecture

#### [Deployment](explanations/deployment.md)

This page explains Tenzir’s deployment architecture, which separates data processing from management through a layered design.

#### [Pipeline](explanations/pipeline.md)

A Tenzir pipeline is a chain of operators that represents a dataflow.

#### [Node](explanations/node.md)

A node is a running process that manages and executes pipelines.

#### [Platform](explanations/platform.md)

The platform provides fleet management for nodes.

This page defines the terms that name things you work with in Tenzir: the components, the entities a pipeline manipulates, and the units we ship.

## [Reference](reference.md)

The reference has nitty-gritty technical descriptions of how Tenzir works.

### Language (TQL)

#### [Type System](reference/types.md)

This page explains TQL’s type system, which provides strong typing with automatic inference.
