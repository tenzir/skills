# Compliance Finding (compliance_finding)

Compliance Finding events describe results of evaluations performed against resources, to check compliance with various Industry Frameworks or Security Standards such as `NIST SP 800-53, CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark v1.4.0, ISO/IEC 27001` etc. Note: if the event producer is a security control, the `security_control` profile should be applied and its `attacks` information, if present, should be duplicated into the `finding_info` object.
Note: If the Finding is an incident, i.e. requires incident workflow, also apply the `incident` profile or aggregate this finding into an `Incident Finding`.
