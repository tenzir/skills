# OSINT (osint)

The OSINT (Open Source Intelligence) object contains details related to an indicator such as the indicator itself, related indicators, geolocation, registrar information, subdomains, analyst commentary, and other contextual information. This information can be used to further enrich a detection or finding by providing decisioning support to other analysts and engineers.

### `confidence`

- **Type**: `string_t`
- **Requirement**: optional

The confidence of an indicator being malicious and/or pertinent, normalized to the caption of the confidence_id value. In the case of 'Other', it is defined by the event source or analyst.

### `confidence_id`

- **Type**: `integer_t`
- **Requirement**: recommended

#### Enum values

- `AMBER`: `TLP:AMBER` - TLP:AMBER is for limited disclosure, recipients can only spread this on a need-to-know basis within their organization and its clients. Note that TLP:AMBER+STRICT restricts sharing to the organization only. Sources may use TLP:AMBER when information requires support to be effectively acted upon, yet carries risk to privacy, reputation, or operations if shared outside of the organizations involved. Recipients may share TLP:AMBER information with members of their own organization and its clients, but only on a need-to-know basis to protect their organization and its clients and prevent further harm. Note: if the source wants to restrict sharing to the organization only, they must specify TLP:AMBER+STRICT.
- `AMBER STRICT`: `TLP:AMBER+STRICT` - TLP:AMBER is for limited disclosure, recipients can only spread this on a need-to-know basis within their organization and its clients. Note that TLP:AMBER+STRICT restricts sharing to the organization only. Sources may use TLP:AMBER when information requires support to be effectively acted upon, yet carries risk to privacy, reputation, or operations if shared outside of the organizations involved. Recipients may share TLP:AMBER information with members of their own organization and its clients, but only on a need-to-know basis to protect their organization and its clients and prevent further harm. Note: if the source wants to restrict sharing to the organization only, they must specify TLP:AMBER+STRICT.
- `CLEAR`: `TLP:CLEAR` - TLP:CLEAR denotes that recipients can spread this to the world, there is no limit on disclosure. Sources may use TLP:CLEAR when information carries minimal or no foreseeable risk of misuse, in accordance with applicable rules and procedures for public release. Subject to standard copyright rules, TLP:CLEAR information may be shared without restriction.
- `GREEN`: `TLP:GREEN` - TLP:GREEN is for limited disclosure, recipients can spread this within their community. Sources may use TLP:GREEN when information is useful to increase awareness within their wider community. Recipients may share TLP:GREEN information with peers and partner organizations within their community, but not via publicly accessible channels. TLP:GREEN information may not be shared outside of the community. Note: when “community” is not defined, assume the cybersecurity/defense community.
- `RED`: `TLP:RED` - TLP:RED is for the eyes and ears of individual recipients only, no further disclosure. Sources may use TLP:RED when information cannot be effectively acted upon without significant risk for the privacy, reputation, or operations of the organizations involved. Recipients may therefore not share TLP:RED information with anyone else. In the context of a meeting, for example, TLP:RED information is limited to those present at the meeting.
- `WHITE`: `TLP:WHITE` - TLP:WHITE and TLP:CLEAR may be used interchangeably, TLP:WHITE is the most up to date (as of TLP 2.0) usage.

The [Traffic Light Protocol](https://www.first.org/tlp/) was created to facilitate greater sharing of potentially sensitive information and more effective collaboration. TLP provides a simple and intuitive schema for indicating with whom potentially sensitive information can be shared.
