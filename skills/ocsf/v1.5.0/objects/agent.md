# Agent (agent)

An Agent (also known as a Sensor) is typically installed on an Operating System (OS) and serves as a specialized software component that can be designed to monitor, detect, collect, archive, or take action. These activities and possible actions are defined by the upstream system controlling the Agent and its intended purpose. For instance, an Agent can include Endpoint Detection & Response (EDR) agents, backup/disaster recovery sensors, Application Performance Monitoring or profiling sensors, and similar software.

#### Enum values

- `1`: `Endpoint Detection and Response` - Any EDR sensor or agent. Or any tool that provides similar threat detection, anti-malware, anti-ransomware, or similar capabilities. E.g., Crowdstrike Falcon, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Wazuh.
- `2`: `Data Loss Prevention` - Any DLP sensor or agent. Or any tool that provides similar data classification, data loss detection, and/or data loss prevention capabilities. E.g., Forcepoint DLP, Microsoft Purview, Symantec DLP.
- `3`: `Backup & Recovery` - Any agent or sensor that provides backups, archival, or recovery capabilities. E.g., Azure Backup, AWS Backint Agent.
- `4`: `Performance Monitoring & Observability` - Any agent or sensor that provides Application Performance Monitoring (APM), active tracing, profiling, or other observability use cases and optionally forwards the logs. E.g., New Relic Agent, Datadog Agent, Azure Monitor Agent.
- `5`: `Vulnerability Management` - Any agent or sensor that provides vulnerability management or scanning capabilities. E.g., Qualys VMDR, Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, Crowdstrike Spotlight, Amazon Inspector Agent.
