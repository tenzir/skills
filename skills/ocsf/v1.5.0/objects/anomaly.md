# Anomaly (anomaly)

Describes an anomaly or deviation detected in a system. Anomalies are unexpected activity patterns that could indicate potential issues needing attention.

- **Extends**: `object`

## Attributes

### `observation_parameter`

- **Type**: `string_t`
- **Requirement**: required

The specific parameter, metric or property where the anomaly was observed. Examples include: CPU usage percentage, API response time in milliseconds, HTTP error rate, memory utilization, network latency, transaction volume, etc. This helps identify the exact aspect of the system exhibiting anomalous behavior.

### `observation_type`

- **Type**: `string_t`
- **Requirement**: recommended

The type of analysis methodology used to detect the anomaly. This indicates how the anomaly was identified through different analytical approaches. Common types include: Frequency Analysis, Time Pattern Analysis, Volume Analysis, Sequence Analysis, Distribution Analysis, etc.

### `observations`

- **Type**: [`observation`](observation.md)
- **Requirement**: required

Details about the observed anomaly or observations that were flagged as anomalous compared to expected baseline behavior.

### `observed_pattern`

- **Type**: `string_t`
- **Requirement**: recommended

The specific pattern identified within the observation type. For Frequency Analysis, this could be 'FREQUENT', 'INFREQUENT', 'RARE', or 'UNSEEN'. For Time Pattern Analysis, this could be 'BUSINESS_HOURS', 'OFF_HOURS', or 'UNUSUAL_TIME'. For Volume Analysis, this could be 'NORMAL_VOLUME', 'HIGH_VOLUME', or 'SURGE'. The pattern values are specific to each observation type and indicate how the observed behavior relates to the baseline.
