# Network Activity (network_activity)

Network Activity events report network connection and traffic activity.

- **Class UID**: `4001`
- **Category**: Network Activity
- **Extends**: [Network (network)](network.md)
- **Profiles**: [Network Proxy](../profiles/network_proxy.md), [Load Balancer](../profiles/load_balancer.md), [Cloud](../profiles/cloud.md), [Date/Time](../profiles/datetime.md), [Host](../profiles/host.md), [OSINT](../profiles/osint.md), [Security Control](../profiles/security_control.md)

## Constraints

- **At least one of**: `dst_endpoint`, `src_endpoint`

## Inherited attributes

**From Network:**
- `connection_info` (recommended)
- `proxy` (recommended)
- `traffic` (recommended)

**From Base Event:**
- `category_uid` (required)
- `class_uid` (required)
- `metadata` (required)
- `severity_id` (required)
- `time` (required)
- `type_uid` (required)
- `message` (recommended)
- `observables` (recommended)
- `status` (recommended)
- `status_code` (recommended)
- `status_detail` (recommended)
- `status_id` (recommended)
- `timezone_offset` (recommended)

## Attributes

### `activity_id`

- **Type**: `integer_t`
- **Sibling**: `activity_name`

#### Enum values

- `1`: `Open` - A new network connection was opened.
- `2`: `Close` - The network connection was closed.
- `3`: `Reset` - The network connection was abnormally terminated or closed by a middle device like firewalls.
- `4`: `Fail` - The network connection failed. For example a connection timeout or no route to host.
- `5`: `Refuse` - The network connection was refused. For example an attempt to connect to a server port which is not open.
- `6`: `Traffic` - Network traffic report.
- `7`: `Listen` - A network endpoint began listening for new network connections.

The normalized identifier of the activity that triggered the event.

### `dst_endpoint`

- **Type**: [`network_endpoint`](../objects/network_endpoint.md)

The destination endpoint of the network activity — typically the responder. In bi-flow or asymmetric flow scenarios, this endpoint may represent the true initiator of the original communication. Use `initiator_id` to determine which endpoint actually initiated the communication.

### `initiator`

- **Type**: `string_t`
- **Requirement**: optional

The endpoint that initiated the network communication, normalized to the caption of `initiator_id`. In the case of `Other`, it is defined by the event source.

### `initiator_id`

- **Type**: `integer_t`
- **Requirement**: recommended
- **Group**: primary
- **Sibling**: `initiator`

#### Enum values

- `0`: `Unknown`
- `1`: `Source Endpoint` - The `src_endpoint` is the true initiator and the source/destination assignment is correct.
- `2`: `Destination Endpoint` - The `dst_endpoint` is the true initiator and the source/destination assignment is reversed.
- `99`: `Other`

The normalized identifier of the endpoint that initiated the network communication. Use this field to disambiguate source and destination roles in bi-directional or asymmetric flow scenarios.

### `is_src_dst_assignment_known`

- **Type**: `boolean_t`
- **Requirement**: recommended
- **Group**: primary

`true` denotes that `src_endpoint` and `dst_endpoint` correctly identify the initiator and responder respectively. `false` denotes that the event source has arbitrarily assigned one peer to `src_endpoint` and the other to `dst_endpoint`, in other words that initiator and responder are not being asserted. This can occur, for example, when the event source is a network appliance that has not observed the initiation of a given connection. In the absence of this attribute, interpretation of the initiator and responder is implementation-specific.

### `src_endpoint`

- **Type**: [`network_endpoint`](../objects/network_endpoint.md)

The source endpoint of the network activity — typically the initiator. In bi-flow or asymmetric flow scenarios, this endpoint may represent the response side of communication originally initiated by the destination. Use `initiator_id` to determine which endpoint actually initiated the communication.

### `url`

- **Type**: [`url`](../objects/url.md)
- **Requirement**: recommended
- **Group**: primary

The URL details relevant to the network traffic.
