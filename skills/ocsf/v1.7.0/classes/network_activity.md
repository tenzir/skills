# Network Activity (network_activity)

Network Activity events report network connection and traffic activity.

- **Class UID**: `4001`
- **Category**: Network Activity
- **Extends**: [Network (network)](network.md)
- **Profiles**: `network_proxy`, `load_balancer`, `cloud`, `datetime`, `host`, `osint`, `security_control`

## Constraints

- **At least one of**: `dst_endpoint`, `src_endpoint`

## Inherited attributes

**From Network:**
- `connection_info` (recommended)
- `proxy` (recommended)
- `traffic` (recommended)

**From Base Event:**
- `category_uid` (required)
- `class_uid` (required)
- `metadata` (required)
- `severity_id` (required)
- `time` (required)
- `type_uid` (required)
- `message` (recommended)
- `observables` (recommended)
- `status` (recommended)
- `status_code` (recommended)
- `status_detail` (recommended)
- `status_id` (recommended)
- `timezone_offset` (recommended)

## Attributes

### `activity_id`

- **Type**: `integer_t`
- **Sibling**: `activity_name`

#### Enum values

- `1`: `Open` - A new network connection was opened.
- `2`: `Close` - The network connection was closed.
- `3`: `Reset` - The network connection was abnormally terminated or closed by a middle device like firewalls.
- `4`: `Fail` - The network connection failed. For example a connection timeout or no route to host.
- `5`: `Refuse` - The network connection was refused. For example an attempt to connect to a server port which is not open.
- `6`: `Traffic` - Network traffic report.
- `7`: `Listen` - A network endpoint began listening for new network connections.

The normalized identifier of the activity that triggered the event.

### `dst_endpoint`

- **Type**: [`network_endpoint`](../objects/network_endpoint.md)

The responder of the network connection. In some contexts an event source cannot correctly identify the responder. Refer to `is_src_dst_assignment_known` for certainty.

### `is_src_dst_assignment_known`

- **Type**: `boolean_t`
- **Requirement**: recommended
- **Group**: primary

`true` denotes that `src_endpoint` and `dst_endpoint` correctly identify the initiator and responder respectively. `false` denotes that the event source has arbitrarily assigned one peer to `src_endpoint` and the other to `dst_endpoint`, in other words that initiator and responder are not being asserted. This can occur, for example, when the event source is a network appliance that has not observed the initiation of a given connection. In the absence of this attribute, interpretation of the initiator and responder is implementation-specific.

### `src_endpoint`

- **Type**: [`network_endpoint`](../objects/network_endpoint.md)

The initiator of the network connection. In some contexts an event source cannot correctly identify the initiator. Refer to `is_src_dst_assignment_known` for certainty.

### `url`

- **Type**: [`url`](../objects/url.md)
- **Requirement**: recommended
- **Group**: primary

The URL details relevant to the network traffic.
