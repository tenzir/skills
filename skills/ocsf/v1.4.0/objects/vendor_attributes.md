# Vendor Attributes (vendor_attributes)

The Vendor Attributes object can be used to represent values of attributes populated by the Vendor/Finding Provider. It can help distinguish between the vendor-prodvided values and consumer-updated values, of key attributes like `severity_id`.
The original finding producer should not populate this object. It should be populated by consuming systems that support data mutability.

- **Extends**: `object`
