# Managed Entity (managed_entity)

The Managed Entity object describes the type and version of an entity, such as a user, device, or policy.  For types in the `type_id` enum list, an associated attribute should be populated.  If the type of entity is not in the `type_id` list, information can be put into the `data` attribute and the `type` attribute should identify the entity.
