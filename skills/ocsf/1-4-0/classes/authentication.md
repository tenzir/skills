### `logon_type`

- **Type**: `string_t`
- **Requirement**: recommended

The logon type, normalized to the caption of the logon_type_id value. In the case of 'Other', it is defined by the event source.

### `logon_type_id`

- **Type**: `integer_t`
- **Requirement**: recommended
- **Group**: primary
- **Sibling**: `logon_type`

- `7`: `Unlock` - A user unlocked the device.
- `8`: `Network Cleartext` - A user logged on to this device from the network. The user's password in the authentication package was not hashed.
- `9`: `New Credentials` - A caller cloned its current token and specified new credentials for outbound connections. The new logon session has the same local identity, but uses different credentials for other network connections.
- `10`: `Remote Interactive` - A remote logon using Terminal Services or remote desktop application.
- `11`: `Cached Interactive` - A user logged on to this device with network credentials that were stored locally on the device and the domain controller was not contacted to verify the credentials.
- `12`: `Cached Remote Interactive` - Same as Remote Interactive. This is used for internal auditing.
- `13`: `Cached Unlock` - Workstation logon.
