## Attributes

### `ai_agent`

- **Type**: [`ai_agent`](../objects/ai_agent.md)
- **Requirement**: optional
- **Group**: context

The autonomous AI agent that performed this operation. Carries model identity via `ai_agent.ai_model`. Populate when the action was performed by an agent rather than a direct model call.

### `ai_capability`

- **Type**: [`ai_capability`](../objects/ai_capability.md)
- **Requirement**: optional
- **Group**: context

The AI capability invoked in this operation: a tool, resource, or prompt, in the sense of the MCP primitives. Records the capability's identity, kind, provenance, declared contracts, and declared safety hints. Transport details remain on the event's transport attributes (e.g., `api`, `http_request`), and affected objects remain in `resources`. Producers deriving `activity_id` from the capability's declared hints (e.g., mapping a declared read-only tool to `Read`) should note the hints are self-declared and unverified; when the observed operation contradicts the declaration, classify by observed behavior.

### `ai_model`

- **Type**: [`ai_model`](../objects/ai_model.md)
- **Requirement**: recommended
- **Group**: context

The AI model involved in this operation. Use for direct model invocations where no autonomous agent is involved. For agent-mediated operations, model identity is carried within `ai_agent.ai_model` instead.

### `delegation`

- **Type**: [`delegation`](../objects/delegation.md)
- **Requirement**: optional
- **Group**: context

The delegation under whose authority this AI operation was performed. Links the event to a durable authorization context independent of traces and sessions, enabling correlation of all events executed under the same delegated authority.

### `message_context`

- **Type**: [`message_context`](../objects/message_context.md)
- **Requirement**: optional
- **Group**: context

Communication context for AI system interactions including protocols, roles, clients, and session information for MCP and other AI communication systems.
