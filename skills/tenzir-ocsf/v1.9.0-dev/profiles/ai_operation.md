## Attributes

### `ai_agent`

- **Type**: [`ai_agent`](../objects/ai_agent.md)
- **Requirement**: optional
- **Group**: context

The autonomous AI agent that performed this operation. Carries model identity via `ai_agent.ai_model`. Populate when the action was performed by an agent rather than a direct model call.

### `ai_model`

- **Type**: [`ai_model`](../objects/ai_model.md)
- **Requirement**: recommended
- **Group**: context

The AI model involved in this operation. Use for direct model invocations where no autonomous agent is involved. For agent-mediated operations, model identity is carried within `ai_agent.ai_model` instead.

### `message_context`

- **Type**: [`message_context`](../objects/message_context.md)
- **Requirement**: optional
- **Group**: context

Communication context for AI system interactions including protocols, roles, clients, and session information for MCP and other AI communication systems.
