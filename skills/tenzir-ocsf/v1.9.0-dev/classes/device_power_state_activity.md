The normalized identifier of the activity that triggered the event. Each event class defines its own set of activity values. Use `0` (Unknown) when the activity cannot be determined. Use `99` (Other) when the activity does not match any defined value, in which case `activity_name` must be populated with the source-specific label.

### `actor`

- **Type**: [`actor`](../objects/actor.md)
- **Requirement**: optional
- **Group**: context

The actor that performed the activity on the `device` object.

### `device`

- **Type**: [`device`](../objects/device.md)

The host or device that changed power state.
