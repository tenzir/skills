# Role Management (role_management)

Role Management events report lifecycle management of a role, as well as privileges, policies, credentials, and resources associated with the role. There are two ways updates to the state of a role may be expressed: Using the `Update` activity, for example when updating multiple items at one time, the `updated_role` reflects the changes made to `iam_role`. Using discrete activities, such as `Assign Privileges` the state change is expressed by the `privileges` attribute. Optionally, on success, the `updated_role` reflects the new state of the role. Roles assigned or removed from users and groups are expressed by the `User Management` and `Group Management` classes.

The normalized identifier of the activity that triggered the event. Each event class defines its own set of activity values. Use `0` (Unknown) when the activity cannot be determined. Use `99` (Other) when the activity does not match any defined value, in which case `activity_name` must be populated with the source-specific label.
