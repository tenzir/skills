## Attributes

### `activity_id`

- **Type**: `integer_t`
- **Sibling**: `activity_name`

#### Enum values

- `1`: `Read` - A clipboard was read from. In user-interface terms, this is a 'paste' operation. If present, `source_process` is the process which performed the `Write` activity or, in other words, the process from which the data was copied.
- `2`: `Write` - A clipboard was written to. In user-interface terms, this is a 'copy' or 'cut' operation.
- `3`: `Clear` - A clipboard was cleared.

The normalized identifier of the activity that triggered the event. Each event class defines its own set of activity values. Use `0` (Unknown) when the activity cannot be determined. Use `99` (Other) when the activity does not match any defined value, in which case `activity_name` must be populated with the source-specific label.

### `source_process`

- **Type**: [`process`](../objects/process.md)
- **Requirement**: optional
- **Group**: context

For a `Read` activity, this is the process which performed the `Write`. In other words, `actor.process` is the process performing the paste and `source_process` is the process that performed the copy.

### `clipboard`

- **Type**: [`clipboard`](../objects/clipboard.md)
- **Requirement**: required
- **Group**: primary

The clipboard that is the target of the activity.
