# User Management (user_management)

User Management events report lifecycle management of a user and account management tasks that are performed, such as a password change or reset, a user being created, updated, deleted, disabled, enabled, locked out or unlocked. There are two ways updates to the state of a user may be expressed: Using the `Update` activity, for example when updating multiple items at one time, the `updated_user` reflects the changes made to `user`. Using discrete activities, such as `Assign Privileges` the state change is expressed by the `privileges` attribute. Optionally, on successful changes, the `updated_user` reflects the new state of the user.
