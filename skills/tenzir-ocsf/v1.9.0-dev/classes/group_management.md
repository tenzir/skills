# Group Management (group_management)

Group Management events report lifecycle management of a group, as well as privileges, roles, and resources associated with the group. There are two ways updates to the state of a group may be expressed: Using the `Update` activity, for example when updating multiple items at one time, the `updated_group` reflects the changes made to `group`. Using discrete activities, such as `Assign Privileges` the state change is expressed by the `privileges` attribute. Optionally, on success, the `updated_group` reflects the new state of the group.
