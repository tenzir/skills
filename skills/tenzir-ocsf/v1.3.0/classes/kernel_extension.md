## Attributes

### `activity_id`

- **Type**: `integer_t`
- **Requirement**: required
- **Group**: classification
- **Sibling**: `activity_name`

#### Enum values

- `0`: `Unknown` - The event activity is unknown.
- `1`: `Load` - A driver/extension was loaded into the kernel
- `2`: `Unload` - A driver/extension was unloaded (removed) from the kernel
- `99`: `Other` - The event activity is not mapped. See the `activity_name` attribute, which contains a data source specific value.

The normalized identifier of the activity that triggered the event.

### `actor`

- **Type**: [`actor`](../objects/actor.md)
- **Requirement**: required
- **Group**: primary

The actor process that loaded or unloaded the driver/extension.

### `driver`

- **Type**: [`kernel_driver`](../objects/kernel_driver.md)
- **Requirement**: required
- **Group**: primary

The driver that was loaded/unloaded into the kernel

### `class_uid`

- **Type**: `integer_t`
- **Requirement**: required
- **Group**: classification
- **Sibling**: `class_name`

#### Enum values

- `1002`: `Kernel Extension Activity` - Kernel Extension events report when a driver/extension is loaded or unloaded into the kernel

The unique identifier of a class. A class describes the attributes available in an event.

### `type_uid`

- **Type**: `long_t`
- **Requirement**: required
- **Group**: classification
- **Sibling**: `type_name`

#### Enum values

- `100200`: `Kernel Extension Activity: Unknown`
- `100201`: `Kernel Extension Activity: Load` - A driver/extension was loaded into the kernel
- `100202`: `Kernel Extension Activity: Unload` - A driver/extension was unloaded (removed) from the kernel
- `100299`: `Kernel Extension Activity: Other`

The event/finding type ID. It identifies the event's semantics and structure. The value is calculated by the logging system as: `class_uid * 100 + activity_id`.
