- **Requirement**: recommended

The CVSS object details Common Vulnerability Scoring System scores from the advisory that are related to the vulnerability.

### `cwe`

- **Type**: [`cwe`](cwe.md)
- **Requirement**: optional

The CWE object represents a weakness in a software system that can be exploited by a threat actor to perform an attack. The CWE object is based on the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) catalog.

A brief description of the CVE Record.

### `epss`

- **Type**: [`epss`](epss.md)
- **Requirement**: optional

The Exploit Prediction Scoring System (EPSS) object describes the estimated probability a vulnerability will be exploited. EPSS is a community-driven effort to combine descriptive information about vulnerabilities (CVEs) with evidence of actual exploitation in-the-wild.

### `modified_time`

- **Type**: `timestamp_t`
- **Requirement**: optional

The Record Modified Date identifies when the CVE record was last updated.

### `product`
