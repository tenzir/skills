# CrowdStrike


This page shows you how to send events from Tenzir to [CrowdStrike Falcon Next-Gen SIEM](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/platform/next-gen-siem/) and collect [CrowdStrike Falcon Data Replicator (FDR)](https://www.crowdstrike.com/resources/data-sheets/falcon-data-replicator/) events into Tenzir through Amazon SQS and Amazon S3.

[CrowdStrike Falcon Next-Gen SIEM](https://www.crowdstrike.com/en-us/platform/next-gen-siem/) is CrowdStrike’s security information and event management platform. Tenzir can forward events to Falcon Next-Gen SIEM through its [HEC/HTTP connector](https://developer.crowdstrike.com/ngsiem/data-ingestion/) and can consume Falcon Data Replicator data from the SQS-to-S3 delivery path used by CrowdStrike and many SIEM integrations.

Validate in your Falcon tenant

The examples use public connector patterns from CrowdStrike and integration partners. Connector names, available parsers, and generated URLs can differ by tenant, region, and entitlement. Use the API URL and parser settings shown in your Falcon console.

## Prerequisites

To send events to Falcon Next-Gen SIEM, you need:

* A Falcon Next-Gen SIEM or Falcon Next-Gen SIEM 10 GB subscription.
* Permission to create a data connection in the Falcon console.
* A HEC/HTTP connector with an assigned parser.
* The API URL and API key generated for the connector.

To collect FDR events, you need:

* An active Falcon Data Replicator feed.
* The notifications URL, which is an SQS queue URL.
* The storage region for the CrowdStrike-managed S3 bucket.
* The FDR client ID and secret.

## Send events to Next-Gen SIEM

In the Falcon console, create a data connection under **Next-Gen SIEM > Data onboarding** and choose the HEC/HTTP connector. Select the parser that matches the events you send. If no parser matches your source format, create one and test it with representative event samples before routing production data.

Use HTTP directly

Although CrowdStrike uses HEC terminology, this connector is not the Splunk HEC contract that [`to_splunk`](/reference/operators/to_splunk.md) implements. Use [`to_http`](/reference/operators/to_http.md) so the pipeline controls the generated Falcon API URL, Bearer authorization header, and parser-specific request body directly.

CrowdStrike integrations commonly use one of two HEC shapes:

* Structured JSON events sent to the connector URL.
* Raw log lines sent to a raw HEC endpoint, often with `/raw` appended to the generated connector URL.

Use the first example when the connector parser expects JSON. Use the second example when you want to forward raw syslog messages and let the CrowdStrike parser extract fields from the original log line.

### Send structured JSON events

If your connector parser expects JSON, send structured events directly. The following example ships a minimal OCSF Network Activity event and preserves the original vendor payload in `raw_data`.

```tql
let $ngsiem_url = "https://cloud-api.us-1.crowdstrike.com/hec/v1/events"
let $ngsiem_headers = {
  "Authorization": f"Bearer {secret("crowdstrike-ngsiem-token")}",
  "Content-Type": "application/x-ndjson",
}


from {
  category_uid: 4,
  class_uid: 4001,
  activity_id: 6,
  severity_id: 1,
  time: 1780756200000,
  type_uid: 400106,
  metadata: {
    product: {name: "Tenzir", vendor_name: "Tenzir"},
    version: "1.8.0",
  },
  src_endpoint: {ip: 10.0.1.12, port: 53014},
  dst_endpoint: {ip: 198.51.100.42, port: 443},
  raw_data: "{\"event\": \"network\", \"src_ip\": \"10.0.1.12\", ...}",
  raw_size: 1804,
}
to_http $ngsiem_url, headers=$ngsiem_headers {
  write_ndjson strip_null_fields=true
}
```

Replace `$ngsiem_url` with the API URL from your Falcon connector. If your parser expects a different JSON shape, adapt the emitted event but keep the payload limited to the fields the parser needs.

### Forward raw syslog messages

If your connector parser expects raw syslog, preserve the original syslog line with `raw_message` and send one line per event to the raw HEC endpoint.

```tql
let $ngsiem_raw_url = "https://cloud-api.us-1.crowdstrike.com/hec/v1/events/raw"
let $ngsiem_headers = {
  "Authorization": f"Bearer {secret("crowdstrike-ngsiem-token")}",
  "Content-Type": "text/plain; charset=utf-8",
}


accept_tcp "0.0.0.0:514" {
  read_syslog raw_message=raw
}
// Example raw: "<34>Nov 16 14:55:56 firewall sshd[1234]: Failed password ..."
to_http $ngsiem_raw_url, headers=$ngsiem_headers {
  // Raw HEC ingests each newline-delimited line as one event.
  write_delimited raw, "\n"
}
```

Use the raw endpoint only when your connector or parser documentation calls for raw data. If CrowdStrike reports event decoding errors, check whether the parser expects structured JSON on the connector URL or raw lines on the `/raw` URL.

Size the connector

If your sustained event rate exceeds the capacity of one Falcon data connector, create additional connectors and route separate streams to them. Use Tenzir pipelines to split the streams by source, tenant, or event type.

## Collect Falcon Data Replicator events

Falcon Data Replicator delivers data as S3 objects and uses SQS notifications to announce new objects. The SQS message contains the bucket name and object key. The S3 object is commonly gzip-compressed newline-delimited JSON.

The following pipeline reads SQS notifications, fetches the referenced S3 objects, parses the FDR events, and publishes them into the `crowdstrike-fdr` topic:

```tql
let $fdr_aws = {
  region: "us-east-1",
  access_key_id: secret("crowdstrike-fdr-client-id"),
  secret_access_key: secret("crowdstrike-fdr-secret"),
}


from_sqs "https://sqs.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/123456789012/crowdstrike-fdr",
  aws_iam=$fdr_aws,
  poll_time=20s,
  batch_size=10,
  visibility_timeout=300s
notification = message.parse_json()
where notification.Records != null
unroll notification.Records
where notification.Records.eventSource == "aws:s3"
bucket = notification.Records.s3.bucket.name
key = notification.Records.s3.object.key.replace("+", "%20").decode_url()
select s3_url=f"s3://{bucket}/{key}",
       s3_event_time=notification.Records.eventTime,
       s3_event_name=notification.Records.eventName,
       sqs_message_id=message_id
each {
  from_s3 $this.s3_url, aws_iam=$fdr_aws {
    decompress_gzip
    read_ndjson
  }
  crowdstrike.fdr.s3_url = $this.s3_url
  crowdstrike.fdr.s3_event_time = $this.s3_event_time
  crowdstrike.fdr.s3_event_name = $this.s3_event_name
  crowdstrike.fdr.sqs_message_id = $this.sqs_message_id
  publish "crowdstrike"
}
```

Replace the queue URL and region with the values from your FDR feed.

Shared FDR queues

By default, [`from_sqs`](/reference/operators/from_sqs) deletes notifications after it emits them. Add `keep_messages=true` only when Tenzir shares an existing queue or you want to replay notifications during testing. In that mode, downstream pipelines should deduplicate events by `crowdstrike.fdr.s3_url`, event ID, or native event time.
