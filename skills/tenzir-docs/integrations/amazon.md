# Overview


Tenzir integrates with the services from [Amazon Web Services (AWS)](https://aws.amazon.com) listed below.

## Configuration

To interact with AWS services, you need to provide appropriate credentials.

### Inline credentials

All AWS operators support an `aws_iam` parameter for specifying credentials directly in the pipeline:

```tql
load_sqs "my-queue", aws_iam={
  region: "us-east-1",
  access_key_id: "AKIAIOSFODNN7EXAMPLE",
  secret_access_key: "wJalrXUtnFEMI/K7MDENG/bPxRfiCYEXAMPLEKEY"
}
```

You can also use the `aws_iam` parameter to assume an IAM role:

```tql
load_s3 "s3://my-bucket/data.json", aws_iam={
  assume_role: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/MyRole",
  session_name: "tenzir-session"
}
```

### Web identity authentication

For cross-cloud authentication, you can use OIDC tokens from external identity providers like Azure, Google Cloud, or custom OIDC endpoints. This approach uses the AWS `AssumeRoleWithWebIdentity` API to exchange an OIDC token for temporary AWS credentials.

```tql
load_s3 "s3://my-bucket/data.json", aws_iam={
  region: "us-east-1",
  assume_role: "arn:aws:iam::123456789012:role/CrossCloudRole",
  web_identity: {
    token_file: "/var/run/secrets/tokens/aws-token"
  }
}
```

The `web_identity` option supports three token sources:

* **`token_file`**: Path to a file containing the JWT token. This is standard for Kubernetes workload identity where the platform mounts a service account token into the pod.

* **`token_endpoint`**: Configuration for fetching tokens from an HTTP endpoint. Contains `url`, optional `headers`, and optional `path` for JSON extraction. Use this for Azure IMDS or similar metadata services.

* **`token`**: Direct token value for testing or when tokens come from another source.

Credentials automatically refresh before expiration, making this suitable for long-running pipelines.

### Default credential chain

If no `aws_iam` parameter is specified, operators use AWS’s [default credentials provider chain](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sdk-for-cpp/v1/developer-guide/credentials.html).

Make sure to configure AWS credentials for the same user account that runs `tenzir` and `tenzir-node`. The AWS CLI creates configuration files for the current user under `~/.aws`, which can only be read by the same user account.

The `tenzir-node` systemd unit by default creates a `tenzir` user and runs as that user, meaning that the AWS credentials must also be configured for that user. The directory `~/.aws` must be readable for the `tenzir` user.
