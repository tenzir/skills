# AMQP


The [Advanced Message Queuing Protocol (AMQP)](https://www.amqp.org/) is an open standard application layer protocol for message-oriented middleware.

The diagram below shows the key abstractions and how they relate to a pipeline:

Tenzir supports sending and receiving messages via AMQP version 0-9-1.

URL Support

The URL scheme `amqp://` dispatches to [`load_amqp`](../reference/operators/load_amqp.md) and [`save_amqp`](../reference/operators/save_amqp.md) for seamless URL-style use via [`from`](../reference/operators/from.md) and [`to`](../reference/operators/to.md).

## Examples

### Send events to an AMQP exchange

```tql
from {
  x: 42,
  y: "foo",
}
to "amqp://admin:pass@0.0.0.1:5672/vhost"
```

### Receive events from an AMQP queue

```tql
from "amqp://admin:pass@0.0.0.1:5672/vhost"
```
