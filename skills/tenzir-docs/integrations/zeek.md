# Zeek


The [Zeek](https://zeek.org) network monitor translates raw packets into structured logs. Tenzir supports various Zeek use cases, such as continuous ingestion, ad-hoc log file processing, and even generating Zeek logs.

Zeek logs come in three forms in practice, all of which Tenzir can parse natively:

1. Tab-Separated Values (TSV) with a custom header.
2. One NDJSON file for all log types combined (aka. *JSON Streaming*)
3. One NDJSON file per log type.

## Examples

### Ingest logs into a node

To ingest Zeek logs into a Tenzir node, you have multiple options.

#### Easy-button import with the official Zeek package

Our official [Zeek package](https://github.com/tenzir/zeek-tenzir) makes it easy to ship your Zeek logs to a Tenzir node. Install the package first:

```bash
zkg install zeek-tenzir
```

Then add this to your `$PREFIX/share/zeek/site/local.zeek` to send all logs that Zeek produces to a Tenzir node:

```plaintext
@load tenzir/import


# Uncomment to keep the original Zeek logs.
# redef Tenzir::delete_after_postprocesing=F;
```

For ad-hoc command line processing you can also pass `tenzir/import` to a Zeek invocation:

```bash
# Ship logs to it and delete the original files.
zeek -r trace.pcap tenzir/import


# Ship logs to it and keep the original files.
zeek -r trace.pcap tenzir/import Tenzir::delete_after_postprocesing=F
```

#### Run an import pipeline when rotating logs

If you cannot use our Zeek package, it is still possible to let Zeek trigger an import pipeline upon rotation. Zeek’s [logging framework](https://docs.zeek.org/en/master/frameworks/logging.html) can execute a shell script whenever it rotates a log file.

This requires setting `Log::default_rotation_interval` to a non-zero value. The default of `0 secs` means that log rotation is disabled. Add this to `$PREFIX/share/zeek/site/local.zeek`, which is the place for local configuration changes:

```plaintext
redef Log::default_rotation_interval = 1 day;
```

Then redefine [`Log::default_rotation_postprocessor_cmd`](https://docs.zeek.org/en/master/scripts/base/frameworks/logging/main.zeek.html#id-Log::default_rotation_postprocessor_cmd) to point to your shell script, e.g., `/usr/local/bin/ingest`:

```plaintext
redef Log::default_rotation_postprocessor_cmd=/usr/local/bin/ingest;
```

Here is an example `ingest` script that imports all files into a Tenzir node:

ingest

```bash
#!/bin/sh


file_name="$1"
base_name="$2"
from="$3"
to="$4"
terminating="$5"
writer="$6"


if [ "$writer" = "ascii" ]; then
  read="read_zeek_tsv"
elif [ "$writer" = "json" ]; then
  read="read_zeek_json"
else
  echo "unsupported Zeek writer: $writer"
  exit 1
fi


pipeline="load_file \"$file_name\" | $read | import"


tenzir "$pipeline"
```

Our blog post [Native Zeek Log Rotation & Shipping](https://tenzir.com/blog/native-zeek-log-rotation-and-shipping) provides further details on this method.

### Run Zeek on a packet pipeline

You can run Zeek on a pipeline of PCAP packets and continue processing the logs in the same pipeline. A stock Tenzir installation comes with a user-defined `zeek` operator that looks as follows:

tenzir.yaml

```yaml
tenzir:
  operators:
    zeek: |
      shell "eval \"$(zkg env)\" &&
             zeek -r - LogAscii::output_to_stdout=T
             JSONStreaming::disable_default_logs=T
             JSONStreaming::enable_log_rotation=F
             json-streaming-logs"
      read_zeek_json
```

This allows you run Zeek on a packet trace as follows:

```bash
tenzir 'load_file "/path/to/trace.pcap" | zeek'
```

You can also perform more elaborate packet filtering after light-weight [decapsulation](../reference/functions/decapsulate.md):

```bash
tenzir 'load_file "/path/to/trace.pcap"
        read_pcap
        this = decapsulate(this)
        where ip.src in 10.0.0.0/8 || community == "1:YXWfTYEyYLKVv5Ge4WqijUnKTrM="
        write_pcap
        zeek'
```

### Process logs with a pipeline on the command line

Zeek ships with a helper utility `zeek-cut` that operators on Zeek’s tab-separated logs. For example, to extract the host pairs from a conn log:

```bash
zeek-cut id.orig_h id.resp_h < conn.log
```

The list of arguments to `zeek-cut` are the column names of the log. The [`select`](../reference/operators/select.md) operator performs the equivalent in Tenzir after we parse the logs as Zeek TSV:

```bash
tenzir 'read_zeek_tsv | select id.orig_h id.resp_h' < conn.log
```

Since pipelines are *multi-schema* and the Zeek TSV parser is aware of log boundaries, you can also concatenate logs of various types:

```bash
cat *.log | tenzir 'read_zeek_tsv | select id.orig_h id.resp_h'
```

### Generate Zeek TSV from arbitrary data

You can render any data as Zeek TSV log using [`write_zeek_tsv`](../reference/operators/write_zeek_tsv.md):

For example, this is how you create a filtered version of a Zeek conn.log:

```tql
subscribe "zeek"
where @name == "zeek.conn"
where duration > 2s and id.orig_p != 80
write_zeek_tsv
save_file "filtered_conn.log"
```
