# FTP


Tenzir supports the [File Transfer Protocol (FTP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File_Transfer_Protocol), both downloading and uploading files. Use [`from_ftp`](http://docs.tenzir.com/reference/operators/from_ftp.md) to download bytes and parse them with a subpipeline, and use [`to_ftp`](http://docs.tenzir.com/reference/operators/to_ftp.md) to print events with a subpipeline and upload the result.

FTP consists of two separate TCP connections, one control and one data connection. This can be tricky for some firewalls and may require special attention.

## Examples

These examples use the direct FTP operators with explicit parsing and printing subpipelines.

### Download and parse a file from an FTP server

Use [`from_ftp`](http://docs.tenzir.com/reference/operators/from_ftp.md) with [`read_ndjson`](http://docs.tenzir.com/reference/operators/read_ndjson.md) to turn the downloaded bytes into events.

```tql
from_ftp "ftp://user:pass@ftp.example.org/path/to/file.ndjson" {
  read_ndjson
}
```

### Upload events to an FTP server

Use [`to_ftp`](http://docs.tenzir.com/reference/operators/to_ftp.md) with [`write_ndjson`](http://docs.tenzir.com/reference/operators/write_ndjson.md) to serialize events before uploading them.

```tql
from {
  x: 42,
  y: "foo",
}
to_ftp "ftp://user:pass@ftp.example.org/a/b/c/events.ndjson" {
  write_ndjson
}
```
