# SQS


[Amazon Simple Queuing Service (SQS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) is a managed message queue for microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.

Tenzir can interact with SQS by sending messages to and reading messages from SQS queues.

When reading from SQS queues, you cannot specify individual messages. Instead, you determine the maximum number of messages you wish to retrieve, up to a limit of 10.

If the parameter `poll_interval` is non-zero, the pipeline automatically performs [long polling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-short-and-long-polling.html). This means that you may receive messages in bursts, according to your specified poll interval.

Tenzir pipelines that read from an SQS queue automatically send a deletion request after having received the messages.

URL Support

The URL scheme `sqs://` dispatches to [`load_sqs`](../../reference/operators/load_sqs.md) and [`save_sqs`](../../reference/operators/save_sqs.md) for seamless URL-style use via [`from`](../../reference/operators/from.md) and [`to`](../../reference/operators/to.md).

## Configuration

Follow the [standard configuration instructions](../amazon.md) to authenticate with your AWS credentials.

Alternatively, use the `aws_iam` parameter to provide explicit credentials:

```tql
load_sqs "my-queue", aws_iam={
  region: "us-east-1",
  access_key_id: secret("aws-key"),
  secret_access_key: secret("aws-secret")
}
```

See the [`load_sqs`](../../reference/operators/load_sqs.md) and [`save_sqs`](../../reference/operators/save_sqs.md) operator documentation for all available options, including IAM role assumption.

## Examples

### Send a message to an SQS queue

```tql
from {foo: 42}
to "sqs://my-queue" {
  write_json
}
```

### Receive messages from an SQS queue

```tql
from "sqs://my-queue", poll_interval=5s {
  read_json
}
```

```tql
{foo: 42}
```
