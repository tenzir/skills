# SQS


[Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sqs/) is a managed message queue on AWS. It supports microservices, distributed systems, and serverless applications.

Tenzir can interact with SQS by sending messages to and reading messages from SQS queues.

When reading from SQS queues, Tenzir receives one SQS message at a time and emits the message body in the `message` field, together with SQS metadata such as the message ID and receive count.

The `poll_time` parameter configures [long polling](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSSimpleQueueService/latest/SQSDeveloperGuide/sqs-short-and-long-polling.html). This reduces empty responses when there are no messages available.

Tenzir pipelines that read from an SQS queue automatically send a deletion request after receiving messages.

URL Support

Use `from_sqs` and `to_sqs` directly with `sqs://` URLs.

## Configuration

Follow the [standard configuration instructions](../amazon.md) to authenticate with your AWS credentials.

Alternatively, use the `aws_iam` parameter to provide explicit credentials:

```tql
from_sqs "my-queue", aws_iam={
  region: "us-east-1",
  access_key_id: secret("aws-key"),
  secret_access_key: secret("aws-secret")
}
```

See the `from_sqs` and `to_sqs` operator documentation for all available options, including IAM role assumption.

## Examples

### Send a message to an SQS queue

```tql
from {foo: 42}
to_sqs "sqs://my-queue"
```

### Receive messages from an SQS queue

```tql
from_sqs "sqs://my-queue", poll_time=5s
this = message.parse_json()
```

```tql
{foo: 42}
```
