# to_azure_blob_storage


Writes events to one or multiple blobs in Azure Blob Storage.

```tql
to_azure_blob_storage url:string, [account_key=string, max_size=int,
                     timeout=duration, partition_by=list<field>] { … }
```

## Description

The `to_azure_blob_storage` operator writes events to Azure Blob Storage, automatically opening new blobs when a rotation condition triggers. It supports hive-style partitioning through a `**` placeholder in the URL and per-partition unique blob names through a `{uuid}` placeholder.

By default, authentication is handled by the Azure SDK’s credential chain which may read from multiple environment variables, such as:

* `AZURE_TENANT_ID`
* `AZURE_CLIENT_ID`
* `AZURE_CLIENT_SECRET`
* `AZURE_AUTHORITY_HOST`
* `AZURE_CLIENT_CERTIFICATE_PATH`
* `AZURE_FEDERATED_TOKEN_FILE`

### `url: string`

URL identifying the Azure Blob Storage location where data should be written.

Supported URI formats:

1. `abfs[s]://<account>.blob.core.windows.net[/<container>[/<path>]]`
2. `abfs[s]://<container>@<account>.dfs.core.windows.net[/<path>]`
3. `abfs[s]://[<account>@]<host>[.<domain>][:<port>][/<container>[/<path>]]`
4. `abfs[s]://[<account>@]<container>[/<path>]`

(1) and (2) are compatible with the Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2 URIs, (3) is for Azure Blob Storage compatible services including Azurite, and (4) is a shorter version of (1) and (2).

The path portion may contain two placeholders:

* `**` marks the location where hive partition segments are inserted. When present, `partition_by` must also be set, and vice versa.
* `{uuid}` expands to a fresh UUIDv7 for every blob. This is required when partitioning or when rotation can produce multiple blobs, so that rotated or per-partition blobs do not overwrite each other.

Authenticate with the Azure CLI

Run `az login` on the command-line to authenticate the current user with Azure’s command-line arguments.

### `account_key = string (optional)`

Account key for authenticating with Azure Blob Storage.

### `max_size = int (optional)`

Rotates to a new file after the current file exceeds this size in bytes. Because rotation only fires after the threshold is crossed, individual files may be slightly larger than `max_size`.

Defaults to `100M`.

### `timeout = duration (optional)`

Rotates to a new file after the current file has been open for this duration. Rotation is measured from the time the file was first opened.

Defaults to `5min`.

### `partition_by = list<field> (optional)`

A list of fields used to partition events into separate files. For every distinct combination of partition-field values, a separate file (or group of rotated files) is written. The URL must contain a `**` placeholder, which is replaced by the hive-style path `field1=value1/field2=value2/…`.

Unlike [`to_hive`](/reference/operators/to_hive.md), the partitioning fields are **not** stripped from the written events — they remain in each record.

### `{ … }`

Pipeline that transforms the incoming events into the byte stream that is written to each file. The pipeline must return bytes, so it must end with a writer such as `write_ndjson`, `write_parquet`, or `write_csv`, optionally followed by a compressor such as `compress_gzip`.

The subpipeline runs once per output file. When rotation or partitioning produces a new file, a new instance of the subpipeline is spawned for it.

## Examples

### Write a single NDJSON blob

```tql
to_azure_blob_storage "abfs://my-container/events/out_{uuid}.json" {
  write_ndjson
}
```

### Partition events into Parquet blobs by date

```tql
to_azure_blob_storage "abfs://my-container/events/**/data_{uuid}.parquet",
  partition_by=[year, month] {
  write_parquet
}
```

### Write with explicit account key

```tql
to_azure_blob_storage "abfs://container/data/out_{uuid}.json",
  account_key="your-account-key" {
  write_ndjson
}
```

### Rotate to a new blob every 5 minutes

```tql
to_azure_blob_storage "abfs://my-container/logs/events_{uuid}.json",
  timeout=5min {
  write_ndjson
}
```
