# from_stdin


Reads and parses events from standard input.

```tql
from_stdin { … }
```

## Description

The `from_stdin` operator reads bytes from standard input and passes them through the provided parsing pipeline to produce events. This is useful when piping data into the `tenzir` executable as part of a shell script or command chain.

### `{ … }`

The pipeline to parse the incoming bytes into events. The pipeline receives raw bytes and must produce events. For example, `{ read_json }` parses the input as JSON.

## Examples

### Parse JSON from standard input

```sh
echo '{"foo": 42}' | tenzir
```

```tql
from_stdin {
  read_json
}
```

```tql
{
  foo: 42,
}
```

### Parse CSV data piped from another command

```sh
cat data.csv | tenzir -f pipeline.tql
```

```tql
from_stdin {
  read_csv
}
```

### Parse Syslog messages

```sh
tail -f /var/log/syslog | tenzir -f pipeline.tql
```

```tql
from_stdin {
  read_syslog
}
```
