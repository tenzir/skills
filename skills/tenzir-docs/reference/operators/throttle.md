# throttle


Limits the throughput of events in a pipeline.

```tql
throttle rate=int, [window=duration, weight=int, drop=bool]
```

## Description

The `throttle` operator controls the data rate of a pipeline by limiting throughput to a maximum rate. By default, it limits the number of events per second. With a custom `weight` expression, it can limit based on bytes or other metrics.

This operator is useful for:

* Preventing downstream systems from being overwhelmed
* Controlling costs when sending data to metered endpoints
* Testing pipeline behavior under rate-limited conditions
* Smoothing bursty traffic patterns

When the rate limit is exceeded, the operator pauses the pipeline until the next window begins. During this pause, incoming events accumulate in memory and back pressure is applied upstream, which can slow down producers. If `drop` is specified, excess events are discarded immediately instead of being queued.

### `rate = int`

The maximum rate per window, specified as a [number](../expressions.md#numbers).

By default (when `weight=1`), this represents events per window. When `weight` is a custom expression, this represents the maximum sum of weight values per window.

### `window = duration (optional)`

The time window over which the rate is measured.

Smaller windows react faster to traffic bursts but may be less smooth. Larger windows provide smoother rate limiting but take longer to adapt to changes.

Defaults to `1s`.

### `weight = int (optional)`

An expression that evaluates to a weight value for each event.

Defaults to `1`, which counts events. Use a custom expression to limit based on bytes or other metrics. For example:

* `this.print_ndjson().length_bytes()` - Serialize event to NDJSON and get byte length
* `this.size` - Use a pre-computed size field
* `this.payload_length` - Use a payload byte-length field
* `1024` - Assume a fixed size per event

### `drop = bool (optional)`

Drop excess events instead of pausing. When `true`, events that would exceed the rate limit are discarded immediately. When `false`, the pipeline pauses and events accumulate in memory until the next window.

Defaults to `false`.

## Examples

### Limit to 1,000 events per second

Limit the number of events processed:

```tql
from "https://api.example.com/events" { read_json }
throttle rate=1000
```

### Limit to 100 events over a 5-second window

Use a larger window for smoother rate limiting:

```tql
from "kafka://events"
throttle rate=100, window=5s
```

### Limit JSON API responses to 10 MiB/s

Limit throughput based on the serialized size of events. Note that serializing each event adds computational overhead for high-volume data flows.

```tql
from "https://api.example.com/events" { read_json }
throttle rate=10Mi, weight=this.print_ndjson().length_bytes()
to "output.json"
```

### Throttle network traffic using packet size

Use the captured packet length for byte-based rate limiting:

```tql
from "network-capture.pcap" { read_pcap }
throttle rate=100Mi, weight=this.captured_packet_length, window=5s
```

### Fixed-size event rate limiting

Assume each event is 512 bytes and limit to 1 MiB/s:

```tql
from "input.json" { read_json }
throttle rate=1Mi, weight=512
```

### Drop events instead of pausing

Drop excess events when the rate limit is reached:

```tql
from "input.json" { read_json }
throttle rate=500, drop=true
```
