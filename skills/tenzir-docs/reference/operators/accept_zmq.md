# accept_zmq


Listens on a ZeroMQ endpoint and receives events.

```tql
accept_zmq endpoint:string, [prefix=string, keep_prefix=bool, { … }]
```

## Description

Binds a ZeroMQ `SUB` socket to the specified endpoint and receives messages that match the configured subscription prefix.

Use `accept_zmq` when Tenzir should own the listening endpoint. This matches the naming used by other transport operators such as [`accept_tcp`](/reference/operators/accept_tcp.md), even though ZeroMQ itself calls this binding rather than accepting.

As with [`from_zmq`](/reference/operators/from_zmq.md), the `prefix` option uses ZeroMQ’s raw subscription filtering. When `keep_prefix=false`, the operator strips the matched prefix before handing the remaining bytes to the nested pipeline.

### `endpoint: string`

The endpoint to listen on, for example `tcp://0.0.0.0:5555`, `ipc://path`, or `inproc://name`.

### `prefix = string (optional)`

A constant subscription prefix to install on the `SUB` socket.

The expression must evaluate to a string before the operator starts receiving messages. It cannot depend on event fields.

Defaults to the empty string, which subscribes to all messages.

### `keep_prefix = bool (optional)`

Whether to keep the matched prefix in the bytes that are passed to the nested pipeline.

Defaults to `false`.

### `{ … } (optional)`

The pipeline to run for incoming message payloads. It receives bytes and must produce events, for example `{ read_json }` or `{ read_syslog }`.

If you omit the nested pipeline, the operator emits one event per message with a single field `message` containing the message payload as a `blob`.

## Examples

### Listen for JSON messages

```tql
accept_zmq "tcp://0.0.0.0:5555" {
  read_json
}
```

### Listen with a subscription prefix

```tql
accept_zmq "tcp://0.0.0.0:5555", prefix="suricata/" {
  read_suricata
}
```
