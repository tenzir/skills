# deduplicate


Removes duplicate events based on a common key.

```tql
deduplicate [keys…:any, limit=int, distance=int, create_timeout=duration,
             write_timeout=duration, read_timeout=duration, count_field=field]
```

## Description

The `deduplicate` operator removes duplicates from a stream of events, based on the value of one or more fields.

### `keys…: any (optional)`

The expressions that form the deduplication key. Pass one or more positional arguments, for example `deduplicate src_ip, dst_ip`, to build a compound key from multiple fields.

Defaults to `this`, i.e., deduplicating entire events.

### `limit = int (optional)`

The number of duplicate keys allowed before an event is suppressed.

Defaults to `1`, which is equivalent to removing all duplicates.

### `distance = int (optional)`

Distance between two events that can be considered duplicates. A value of `1` means that only adjacent events can be considered duplicate.

When unspecified, the distance is infinite.

### `create_timeout = duration (optional)`

The time that needs to pass until a surpressed event is no longer considered a duplicate. The timeout resets when the first event for a given key is let through.

### `write_timeout = duration (optional)`

The time that needs to pass until a suppressed event is no longer considered a duplicate. The timeout resets when any event for a given key is let through.

For a limit of `1`, the write timeout is equivalent to the create timeout.

The write timeout must be smaller than the create timeout.

### `read_timeout = duration (optional)`

The time that needs to pass until a suppressed event is no longer considered a duplicate. The timeout resets when a key is seen, even if the event is suppressed.

The read timeout must be smaller than the write and create timeouts.

### `count_field = field (optional)`

When specified, adds a field to each output event containing the number of events that were dropped since the last output for that key. Events that are the first occurrence of a key or that trigger output after expiration have a count of `0`.

## Examples

### Deduplicate entire events

Deduplicate a stream of events by using `deduplicate` without arguments:

```tql
from \
  {foo: 1, bar: "a"},
  {foo: 1, bar: "a"},
  {foo: 1, bar: "a"},
  {foo: 1, bar: "b"},
  {foo: null, bar: "b"},
  {bar: "b"},
  {foo: null, bar: "b"},
  {foo: null, bar: "b"}
deduplicate
```

```tql
{foo: 1, bar: "a"}
{foo: 1, bar: "b"}
{foo: null, bar: "b"}
{bar: "b"}
```

### Deduplicate events based on single fields

Use `deduplicate bar` to restrict the deduplication to the values of field `bar`:

```tql
from \
  {foo: 1, bar: "a"},
  {foo: 1, bar: "a"},
  {foo: 1, bar: "a"},
  {foo: 1, bar: "b"},
  {foo: null, bar: "b"},
  {bar: "b"},
  {foo: null, bar: "b"},
  {foo: null, bar: "b"}
deduplicate bar
```

```tql
{foo: 1, bar: "a"}
{foo: 1, bar: "b"}
```

When writing `deduplicate foo`, note how the missing `foo` field is treated as if it had the value `null`, i.e., it’s not included in the output.

```tql
from \
  {foo: 1, bar: "a"},
  {foo: 1, bar: "a"},
  {foo: 1, bar: "a"},
  {foo: 1, bar: "b"},
  {foo: null, bar: "b"},
  {bar: "b"},
  {foo: null, bar: "b"},
  {foo: null, bar: "b"}
deduplicate foo?
```

```tql
{foo: 1, bar: "a"}
{foo: null, bar: "b"}
```

### Deduplicate events based on multiple fields

Multiple positional arguments form a tuple that must match entirely to suppress an event. For example, `deduplicate foo, bar` keeps the first event for each unique combination of `foo` and `bar`:

```tql
from \
  {foo: 1, bar: "a", idx: 1},
  {foo: 1, bar: "a", idx: 2},
  {foo: 1, bar: "b", idx: 3},
  {foo: 2, bar: "a", idx: 4},
  {foo: 1, bar: "b", idx: 5}
deduplicate foo, bar
```

```tql
{foo: 1, bar: "a", idx: 1}
{foo: 1, bar: "b", idx: 3}
{foo: 2, bar: "a", idx: 4}
```

### Get up to 10 warnings per hour for each run of a pipeline

```tql
diagnostics live=true
deduplicate pipeline_id, run, limit=10, create_timeout=1h
```

### Get an event whenever the node disconnected from the Tenzir Platform

```tql
metrics "platform", live=true
deduplicate connected, distance=1
where not connected
```

### Track how many duplicates were dropped

Use the `count_field` option to add a field showing how many events were dropped for each key:

```tql
from \
  {x: 1, seq: 1},
  {x: 1, seq: 2},
  {x: 1, seq: 3},
  {x: 2, seq: 4},
  {x: 2, seq: 5},
  {x: 1, seq: 6}
deduplicate x, distance=2, count_field=drop_count
```

```tql
{x: 1, seq: 1, drop_count: 0}
{x: 2, seq: 4, drop_count: 0}
{x: 1, seq: 6, drop_count: 2}
```

The first event has a count of `0`. When the next event with `x: 1` is emitted at `seq: 6`, it shows that 2 events were dropped (seq 2 and 3) before this one was allowed through due to the `distance=2` constraint. The event at `seq: 4` has `x: 2`, which is a different key, so it also has `drop_count: 0`. Events that trigger output after timeout expiration also have a count of `0`, since the deduplication state for that key was reset.
