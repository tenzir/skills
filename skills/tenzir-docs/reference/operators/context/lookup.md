# context::lookup


Performs live filtering of the import feed using a context and translates context updates into historical queries.

```tql
context::lookup name:string, key=field|list, [into=field, yield=field,
                separate=bool, live=bool, retro=bool, parallel=int]
```

## Description

The `lookup` operator performs two actions simultaneously:

1. Translate context updates into historical queries
2. Filter all data newly ingested into the node against any context updates

These two operations combined offer *unified matching*, i.e., automated retro matching by turning context updates into historical queries, and live matching with a context on the import feed.

The diagram below illustrates how the operator works:

### `name: string`

The name of the context to lookup with.

### `key = field|list`

A field, or list of fields to use for matching.

### `into = field (optional)`

The name of the field in which to store the context’s enrichment.

Defaults to the name of the context.

### `separate = bool (optional)`

When multiple fields are provided, duplicate the event for every provided field and enrich them individually.

When using the option, the context moves from `<into>.<field...>` to `<into>` in the resulting event.

### `live = bool (optional)`

Enables live lookup for incoming events.

By default, both retro and live lookups are enabled. Specifying either `retro=true` or `live=true` explicitly disables the other.

### `retro = bool (optional)`

Enables retrospective lookups for previously imported events. The `lookup` operator will then apply a context after a context update.

By default, both retro and live lookups are enabled. Specifying either `retro=true` or `live=true` explicitly disables the other.

### `yield = field (optional)`

Provide a field into the context object to use as the context instead. If the key does not exist within the context, a `null` value is used instead.

### `parallel = int (optional)`

The number of partitions to open in parallel for retrospective lookups. This number directly correlates with memory usage and performance of the `lookup` operator.

Defaults to `3`.

## Examples

### Apply context to incoming and historical events

Apply the context `feodo` to incoming `suricata.flow` events as well as retro-match any historical event to context updates:

```tql
context::lookup "feodo", key=src_ip
where @name == "suricata.flow"
```

### Apply context to incoming events

Apply the context `feodo` to incoming `suricata.flow` events. In this example, only events that are freshly imported will be matched against the `fedo` context.

```tql
context::lookup "feodo", key=src_ip, live=true
where @name == "suricata.flow"
```

### Apply context to historical events

Apply the context `feodo` to historical `suricata.flow` events with every update to `feodo`. In this example, on any `context::update` to the `fedo` context, historical data persisted in the node will be retro-matched against the update.

```tql
context::lookup "feodo", key=src_ip, retro=true
where @name == "suricata.flow"
```
