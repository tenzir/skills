# from_microsoft_graph


Reads events from a Microsoft Graph collection.

```tql
from_microsoft_graph resource:string, auth=record, [delta=bool, poll_interval=duration, version=string, odata=record, tls=bool|record]
```

## Description

The `from_microsoft_graph` operator sends authenticated `GET` requests to the [Microsoft Graph API](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/overview) and emits each object in the OData `value` array as a separate event.

The operator uses Microsoft Entra client credentials to fetch access tokens, adds the `Authorization` header, and refreshes the token when needed. It follows `@odata.nextLink` URLs until the collection is exhausted.

The operator doesn’t inject its own `@` fields into emitted events. Microsoft Graph may include annotation fields on resource objects, and the operator handles them as follows:

| Field         | Behavior                                                                           |
| :------------ | :--------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `@odata.etag` | Omitted from the emitted event when it appears as a top-level resource field.      |
| `@odata.type` | Preserved because it can identify polymorphic Graph resource types.                |
| `@removed`    | Preserved because delta query responses use it to mark deleted or removed objects. |

The operator doesn’t emit OData envelope metadata such as `@odata.context`, `@odata.nextLink`, or `@odata.deltaLink` as events.

By default, the operator performs a one-shot collection read. With `delta=true`, it uses Microsoft Graph delta queries: the initial request reads the resource’s `/delta` endpoint, stores the final `@odata.deltaLink`, and polls that link for incremental changes.

The operator retries throttled and transient Microsoft Graph responses with a bounded default HTTP retry policy. It honors `Retry-After` for throttling responses such as `429 Too Many Requests` and also retries transient service failures such as `503 Service Unavailable` and `504 Gateway Timeout`. Permanent client and authorization failures such as `400 Bad Request`, `401 Unauthorized`, and `403 Forbidden` fail without retries.

Delta query state is in memory. If the pipeline restarts without an executor snapshot that contains the operator state, the next run starts a new initial delta query.

### `resource: string`

The Microsoft Graph resource path to read, without a leading slash or API version. For example, use `users`, `groups`, or `auditLogs/signIns`.

### `auth = record`

Microsoft Entra application credentials for app-only authentication.

The `auth` record supports the following fields:

| Field           | Type                 | Description                                                           |
| :-------------- | :------------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tenant_id`     | `string` or `secret` | The Microsoft Entra tenant ID or tenant domain.                       |
| `client_id`     | `string` or `secret` | The application client ID.                                            |
| `client_secret` | `string` or `secret` | The application client secret.                                        |
| `scope`         | `string` or `secret` | The OAuth scope. Defaults to `https://graph.microsoft.com/.default`.  |
| `authority`     | `string` or `secret` | The OAuth authority. Defaults to `https://login.microsoftonline.com`. |

The application must have the Microsoft Graph application permissions required for the selected resource. For example, reading sign-in logs requires an application permission such as `AuditLog.Read.All`.

### `odata = record (optional)`

OData query options to append to the initial request. Microsoft Graph decides which query options are valid for each resource. In delta mode, these options apply only to the initial `/delta` request. Later polls use the `@odata.deltaLink` exactly as Microsoft Graph returned it.

For example, Microsoft Graph supports `$select` for `users` and `groups` delta queries, but doesn’t support `$top` there. Filters for those delta queries are limited to object ID scoping.

The `odata` record supports the following fields:

| Field    | Type                | Description                                             |
| :------- | :------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------ |
| `filter` | `string`            | A `$filter` expression.                                 |
| `select` | `list<string>`      | Fields to request with `$select`.                       |
| `top`    | `uint64` or `int64` | The page size to request with `$top`; must be positive. |

### `delta = bool (optional)`

Whether to use Microsoft Graph delta queries. Defaults to `false`.

When `delta=true`, pass a Microsoft Graph collection resource that supports delta queries, such as `users` or `groups`. The operator appends `/delta` unless the resource already ends with `/delta`.

The operator doesn’t maintain its own list of delta-capable Microsoft Graph resources. Microsoft Graph support can differ by resource, API version, tenant, and licensing. If a resource doesn’t support delta queries, Microsoft Graph returns the error and Tenzir reports it.

### `poll_interval = duration (optional)`

The time between delta polls after the initial delta query completes. Defaults to `1min`. The value must be positive and is only valid with `delta=true`.

### `version = string (optional)`

The Microsoft Graph API version to use for the initial request. Supported values are `v1.0` and `beta`. Defaults to `v1.0`.

### `tls = bool | record (optional)`

TLS options for Microsoft Graph requests. Use a record to configure options such as `cacert` when a local proxy or custom trust store intercepts HTTPS traffic.

## Examples

### Read Microsoft Entra sign-in logs

```tql
from_microsoft_graph "auditLogs/signIns",
  auth={
    tenant_id: "contoso.onmicrosoft.com",
    client_id: "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
    client_secret: secret("ms-graph-client-secret"),
  },
  odata={
    filter: "createdDateTime ge 2026-04-24T00:00:00Z",
    select: ["id", "createdDateTime", "userPrincipalName", "status"],
    top: 1000,
  }
```

### Read users

```tql
from_microsoft_graph "users",
  auth={
    tenant_id: secret("ms-graph-tenant-id"),
    client_id: secret("ms-graph-client-id"),
    client_secret: secret("ms-graph-client-secret"),
  },
  odata={
    select: ["id", "displayName", "userPrincipalName"],
  }
```

### Read beta users

```tql
from_microsoft_graph "users",
  version="beta",
  auth={
    tenant_id: secret("ms-graph-tenant-id"),
    client_id: secret("ms-graph-client-id"),
    client_secret: secret("ms-graph-client-secret"),
  },
  odata={
    select: ["id", "displayName", "signInActivity"],
  }
```

### Poll user changes with delta queries

```tql
from_microsoft_graph "users",
  delta=true,
  poll_interval=5min,
  auth={
    tenant_id: secret("ms-graph-tenant-id"),
    client_id: secret("ms-graph-client-id"),
    client_secret: secret("ms-graph-client-secret"),
  },
  odata={
    select: ["id", "displayName", "userPrincipalName"],
  }
```
