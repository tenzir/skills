# parallel


Runs a subpipeline across multiple parallel workers.

```tql
parallel [jobs:int] [, route_by=any] { … }
```

## Description

The [`parallel`](/reference/operators/parallel.md) operator distributes incoming events across multiple parallel instances of a subpipeline. Each event is processed by exactly one worker.

Use this operator to parallelize CPU-intensive transformations or I/O-bound operations that would otherwise bottleneck on a single thread.

By default, events are distributed across workers using an adaptive round-robin strategy that keeps worker loads balanced. Use `route_by` to instead route events deterministically by a key, ensuring that all events with the same key value go to the same worker.

This operator may reorder the event stream since workers process events concurrently.

When used as a source operator (without upstream input), `parallel` spawns multiple independent instances of the subpipeline. This is useful for running the same source pipeline with concurrent connections.

Expert Operator

The `parallel` operator is a building block for performance optimization. Use it when you have identified a specific bottleneck that benefits from parallelization. Not all operations scale linearly with parallelism.

### `jobs: int (optional)`

The number of parallel workers to spawn. Must be greater than zero. Defaults to the number of available CPU cores.

### `route_by = any (optional)`

An expression evaluated per event to determine which worker processes it. Events with the same `route_by` value are always sent to the same worker. This guarantees that related events are grouped together, which is required for stateful subpipelines like [`deduplicate`](/reference/operators/deduplicate.md) or [`summarize`](/reference/operators/summarize.md).

Cannot be used when `parallel` is used as a source operator.

### `{ … }`

The subpipeline to run in parallel. The subpipeline may either:

* Produce events as output (transformation)
* End with a sink (void output)

When `parallel` is used as a source operator, the subpipeline runs as an independent source producing events or as a full pipeline ending with a sink.

The subpipeline must not produce bytes as output.

## Examples

### Parse JSON in parallel

Parse raw JSON strings across multiple workers:

```tql
subscribe "raw"
parallel 4 {
  parsed = data.parse_json()
}
```

### Route events by source IP

Ensure events from the same source IP are always handled by the same worker, enabling per-source deduplication:

```tql
subscribe "events"
parallel route_by=src_ip {
  deduplicate src_ip, dst_ip, dst_port
}
```

### Make parallel HTTP requests

Send events to Google SecOps with 4 concurrent connections:

```tql
subscribe "events"
parallel 4 {
  to_google_secops project="…", region="us", instance="…",
                   service_credentials=secret("secops_service_account"),
                   log_type="…", log_text=raw,
                   log_entry_time=ts, collection_time=now()
}
```
