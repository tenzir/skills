## Attributes

### Classification

**`activity_id`**

* **Type**: `integer_t`

* **Requirement**: required

* **Values**:

  * `0` - `Unknown`: The event activity is unknown.
  * `1` - `Connect`: The CONNECT method establishes a tunnel to the server identified by the target resource.
  * `2` - `Delete`: The DELETE method deletes the specified resource.
  * `3` - `Get`: The GET method requests a representation of the specified resource. Requests using GET should only retrieve data.
  * `4` - `Head`: The HEAD method asks for a response identical to a GET request, but without the response body.
  * `5` - `Options`: The OPTIONS method describes the communication options for the target resource.
  * `6` - `Post`: The POST method submits an entity to the specified resource, often causing a change in state or side effects on the server.
  * `7` - `Put`: The PUT method replaces all current representations of the target resource with the request payload.
  * `8` - `Trace`: The TRACE method performs a message loop-back test along the path to the target resource.
  * `99` - `Other`: The event activity is not mapped.

The normalized identifier of the activity that triggered the event.
