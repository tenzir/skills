* **Requirement**: recommended

Describes details about the classifier used for data classification.

**`confidentiality_id`**

* **Type**: `integer_t`

**`discovery_details`**

* **Type**: [`discovery_details`](discovery_details.md)
* **Requirement**: optional

Details about the data discovered by classification job.

* **Requirement**: optional

The total count of discovered entities, by the classification job.

**`uid`**

* **Type**: `string_t`
* **Requirement**: optional

The unique identifier of the classification job.
