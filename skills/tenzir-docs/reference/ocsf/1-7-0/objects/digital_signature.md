# Digital Signature

> The Digital Signature object contains information about the cryptographic mechanism used to verify the authenticity, integrity, and origin of the file or application.


The Digital Signature object contains information about the cryptographic mechanism used to verify the authenticity, integrity, and origin of the file or application.

## Attributes

**`algorithm_id`**

* **Type**: `integer_t`

* **Requirement**: required

* **Values**:

  * `0` - `Unknown`: The algorithm is unknown.
  * `1` - `DSA`: Digital Signature Algorithm (DSA).
  * `2` - `RSA`: Rivest-Shamir-Adleman (RSA) Algorithm.
  * `3` - `ECDSA`: Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm.
  * `4` - `Authenticode`: Microsoft Authenticode Digital Signature Algorithm.
  * `99` - `Other`: The algorithm is not mapped. See the `algorithm` attribute, which contains a data source specific value.

The identifier of the normalized digital signature algorithm.

**`certificate`**

* **Type**: [`certificate`](certificate.md)
* **Requirement**: recommended

The certificate object containing information about the digital certificate.

**`algorithm`**

* **Type**: `string_t`
* **Requirement**: optional

The digital signature algorithm used to create the signature, normalized to the caption of ‘algorithm\_id’. In the case of ‘Other’, it is defined by the event source.

**`created_time`**

* **Type**: `timestamp_t`
* **Requirement**: optional

The time when the digital signature was created.

**`created_time_dt`**

* **Type**: `datetime_t`
* **Requirement**: optional

The time when the digital signature was created.

**`developer_uid`**

* **Type**: `string_t`
* **Requirement**: optional

The developer ID on the certificate that signed the file.

**`digest`**

* **Type**: [`fingerprint`](fingerprint.md)
* **Requirement**: optional

The message digest attribute contains the fixed length message hash representation and the corresponding hashing algorithm information.

**`state`**

* **Type**: `string_t`
* **Requirement**: optional

The digital signature state defines the signature state, normalized to the caption of ‘state\_id’. In the case of ‘Other’, it is defined by the event source.

**`state_id`**

* **Type**: `integer_t`

* **Requirement**: optional

* **Values**:

  * `0` - `Unknown`: The state is unknown.
  * `1` - `Valid`: The digital signature is valid.
  * `2` - `Expired`: The digital signature is invalid because its timestamp does not fall within the certificate’s validity period.
  * `3` - `Revoked`: The digital signature is invalid due to certificate revocation.
  * `4` - `Suspended`: The digital signature is invalid due to certificate suspension.
  * `5` - `Pending`: The digital signature state is pending.
  * `6` - `Untrusted`: The digital signature is invalid because the certificate is rooted in an untrusted CA or is an untrusted self-signed certificate.
  * `7` - `Distrusted`: The digital signature is invalid because the certificate is explicitly distrusted. Note that whereas revocation is global, distrust reflects local IT/security policy.
  * `8` - `WrongUsage`: The digital signature is invalid because the certificate is not intended for code signing purposes.
  * `9` - `Bad`: The digital signature is cryptographically invalid, e.g. a mismatched digest. This indicates possible tampering.
  * `10` - `Broken`: The digital signature is malformed and could not be processed.
  * `99` - `Other`: The state is not mapped. See the `state` attribute, which contains a data source specific value.

The normalized identifier of the signature state.
