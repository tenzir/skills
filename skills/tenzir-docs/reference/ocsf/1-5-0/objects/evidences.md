Additional evidence data that is not accounted for in the specific evidence attributes.` Use only when absolutely necessary.`

**`name`**

* **Type**: `string_t`
* **Requirement**: optional

The naming convention or type identifier of the evidence associated with the security detection. For example, the `@odata.type` from Microsoft Graph Alerts V2 or `display_name` from CrowdStrike Falcon Incident Behaviors.

**`uid`**

* **Type**: `string_t`
* **Requirement**: optional

The unique identifier of the evidence associated with the security detection. For example, the `activity_id` from CrowdStrike Falcon Alerts or `behavior_id` from CrowdStrike Falcon Incident Behaviors.

**`verdict`**

* **Type**: `string_t`
* **Requirement**: optional

The normalized verdict of the evidence associated with the security detection.

**`verdict_id`**

* **Type**: `integer_t`

* **Requirement**: optional

* **Values**:

  * `0` - `Unknown`: The type is unknown.
  * `1` - `False Positive`: The verdict for the evidence has been identified as a False Positive.
  * `2` - `True Positive`: The verdict for the evidence has been identified as a True Positive.
  * `3` - `Disregard`: The verdict for the evidence is that is should be Disregarded.
  * `4` - `Suspicious`: The verdict for the evidence is that the behavior has been identified as Suspicious.
  * `5` - `Benign`: The verdict for the evidence is that the behavior has been identified as Benign.
  * `6` - `Test`: The evidence is part of a Test, or other sanctioned behavior(s).
  * `7` - `Insufficient Data`: There is insufficient data to render a verdict on the evidence.
  * `8` - `Security Risk`: The verdict for the evidence is that the behavior has been identified as a Security Risk.
  * `9` - `Managed Externally`: The verdict for the evidence is Managed Externally, such as in a case management tool.
  * `10` - `Duplicate`: This evidence duplicates existing evidence related to this finding.
  * `99` - `Other`: The type is not mapped. See the `type` attribute, which contains a data source specific value.

The normalized verdict (or status) ID of the evidence associated with the security detection. For example, Microsoft Graph Security Alerts contain a `verdict` enumeration for each type of `evidence` associated with the Alert. This is typically set by an automated investigation process or an analyst/investigator assigned to the finding.
