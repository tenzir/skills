# parse_grok


Parses a string according to a grok pattern.

```tql
parse_grok(input:string, pattern:string, [pattern_definitions=record|string,
           indexed_captures=bool, include_unnamed=bool,
           schema=string, selector=string, schema_only=bool,
           raw=bool, unflatten_separator=string]) -> record
```

## Description

`parse_grok` uses a regular expression based parser similar to the [Logstash `grok` plugin](https://www.elastic.co/guide/en/logstash/current/plugins-filters-grok.html) in Elasticsearch. Tenzir ships with the same built-in patterns as Elasticsearch, found [here](https://github.com/logstash-plugins/logstash-patterns-core/tree/main/patterns/ecs-v1).

In short, `pattern` consists of replacement fields, that look like `%{SYNTAX[:SEMANTIC[:CONVERSION]]}`, where:

* `SYNTAX` is a reference to a pattern, either built-in or user-defined through the `pattern_defintions` option.
* `SEMANTIC` is an identifier that names the field in the parsed record.
* `CONVERSION` is either `infer` (default), `string` (default with `raw=true`), `int`, or `float`.

The supported regular expression syntax is the one supported by [Boost.Regex](https://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_81_0/libs/regex/doc/html/boost_regex/syntax/perl_syntax.html), which is effectively Perl-compatible.

### `input: string`

The string to parse.

### `pattern: string`

The `grok` pattern used for matching. Must match the input in its entirety.

### `pattern_definitions = record|string (optional)`

New pattern definitions to use. This may be a record of the form

```tql
{
  pattern_name: "pattern", …
}
```

For example, the built-in pattern `INT` would be defined as

```tql
{ INT: "(?:[+-]?(?:[0-9]+))" }
```

Alternatively, this may be a user-defined newline-delimited list of patterns, where a line starts with the pattern name, followed by a space, and the `grok`-pattern for that pattern. For example, the built-in pattern `INT` is defined as follows:

```plaintext
INT (?:[+-]?(?:[0-9]+))
```

### `indexed_captures = bool (optional)`

All subexpression captures are included in the output, with the `SEMANTIC` used as the field name if possible, and the capture index otherwise.

### `include_unnamed = bool (optional)`

By default, only fields that were given a name with `SEMANTIC`, or with the regular expression named capture syntax `(?<name>...)` are included in the resulting record.

With `include_unnamed=true`, replacement fields without a `SEMANTIC` are included in the output, using their `SYNTAX` value as the record field name.

### `raw = bool (optional)`

Use only the raw types that are native to the parsed format. Fields that have a type specified in the chosen `schema` will still be parsed according to the schema.

### `schema = string (optional)`

Provide the name of a schema to be used by the parser.

If a schema with a matching name is installed, the result will always have all fields from that schema.

* Fields that are specified in the schema, but did not appear in the input will be null.
* Fields that appear in the input, but not in the schema will also be kept. Use `schema_only=true` to reject fields that are not in the schema.

If the given schema does not exist, this option instead assigns the output schema name only.

The `schema` option is incompatible with the `selector` option.

### `selector = string (optional)`

Designates a field value as schema name with an optional dot-separated prefix.

The string is parsed as `<fieldname>[:<prefix>]`. The `prefix` is optional and will be prepended to the field value to generate the schema name.

For example, the Suricata EVE JSON format includes a field `event_type` that contains the event type. Setting the selector to `event_type:suricata` causes an event with the value `flow` for the field `event_type` to map onto the schema `suricata.flow`.

The `selector` option is incompatible with the `schema` option.

### `schema_only = bool (optional)`

When working with an existing schema, this option will ensure that the output schema has *only* the fields from that schema.

If the schema name is obtained via a `selector` and it does not exist, this has no effect.

This option requires either `schema` or `selector` to be set.

### `unflatten_separator = string (optional)`

A delimiter that, if present in keys, causes values to be treated as values of nested records.

A popular example of this is the [Zeek JSON](../operators/read_zeek_json.md) format. It includes the fields `id.orig_h`, `id.orig_p`, `id.resp_h`, and `id.resp_p` at the top-level. The data is best modeled as an `id` record with four nested fields `orig_h`, `orig_p`, `resp_h`, and `resp_p`.

Without an unflatten separator, the data looks like this:

Without unflattening

```json
{
  "id.orig_h": "1.1.1.1",
  "id.orig_p": 10,
  "id.resp_h": "1.1.1.2",
  "id.resp_p": 5
}
```

With the unflatten separator set to `.`, Tenzir reads the events like this:

With 'unflatten'

```json
{
  "id": {
    "orig_h": "1.1.1.1",
    "orig_p": 10,
    "resp_h": "1.1.1.2",
    "resp_p": 5
  }
}
```

### Duplicate Keys

If the parser encounters a duplicate key in an event, it will transparently upgrade the field to be a list of values instead.

For a simple example, consider this JSON file:

Duplicate Keys

```json
{"key": 7}
{"key": 0.0, "key": 1}
{"key": 42}
```

```tql
{key: 7}
{key: [0.0, 1.0]}
{key: 42}
```

If the values are of different type, conversions to a common type will be attempted, such as to a common number type. Ultimately values will be stringified if they do not share a common type:

Type Conflict

```json
{"key": 0.0, "key": "1.1.1.1", "key": "example.com"}
```

```tql
{key: ["0", "1.1.1.1", "example.com"]}
```

## Examples

```tql
let $pattern = "%{IP:client} %{WORD} %{URIPATHPARAM:req} %{NUMBER:bytes} %{NUMBER:dur}"
from { input: "55.3.244.1 GET /index.html 15824 0.043" }
output = input.parse_grok($pattern)
output.dur = output.dur * 1s
```

```tql
{
  input: "55.3.244.1 GET /index.html 15824 0.043",
  output: {
    client: 55.3.244.1,
    req: "/index.html",
    bytes: 15824,
    dur: 43.0ms
  }
}
```
