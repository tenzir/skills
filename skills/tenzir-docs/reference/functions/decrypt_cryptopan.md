# decrypt_cryptopan

> Decrypts an IP address via Crypto-PAn.

Decrypts an IP address via Crypto-PAn.

```tql
decrypt_cryptopan(address:ip, [seed=string], [family=string])
```

## Description

The `decrypt_cryptopan` function decrypts an IP `address` that was encrypted with [`encrypt_cryptopan`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/functions/encrypt_cryptopan.md) and the same seed.

Tenzir represents IPv4 addresses as IPv4-mapped IPv6 addresses with the `::ffff/96` prefix. [`encrypt_cryptopan`](https://tenzir.com/docs/reference/functions/encrypt_cryptopan.md) preserves this prefix for IPv4 addresses and permutes only the final 32 bits. For IPv6 addresses, it permutes the full 128-bit address.

By default, `decrypt_cryptopan` infers the address family from the ciphertext: addresses under `::ffff/96` decrypt as IPv4, and all other addresses decrypt as IPv6. A true IPv6 ciphertext can still land under `::ffff/96`, but this requires the first 96 encrypted bits to match the IPv4-mapped prefix exactly. The probability is therefore `2^-96`, or about `1.26e-29`.

### `address: ip`

The IP address to decrypt.

### `seed = string (optional)`

A 64-character seed that describes a hexadecimal value. When the seed is shorter than 64 characters, the function appends zeros to match the size; when it is longer, it truncates the seed.

### `family = string (optional)`

The Crypto-PAn address family to decrypt in. Valid values are `ipv4` and `ipv6`.

Set this to `ipv6` when decrypting an IPv6 ciphertext that happens to look like an IPv4-mapped address.

## Examples

### Decrypt IP address fields

```tql
let $seed = "000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f101112131415161718191a1b1c1d1e1f"
from {
  src: decrypt_cryptopan(2.90.93.17, seed=$seed),
  dst: decrypt_cryptopan(dd92:2c44:3fc0:ff1e:7ff9:c7f0:8180:7e00, seed=$seed),
}
```

```tql
{
  src: 192.0.2.1,
  dst: 2001:db8::1,
}
```

### Decrypt an IPv4-mapped IPv6 ciphertext

```tql
let $seed = "000102030405060708090a0b0c0d0e0f101112131415161718191a1b1c1d1e1f"
from {
  address: decrypt_cryptopan(192.0.2.1, seed=$seed, family="ipv6"),
}
```

```tql
{
  address: c3ff:3ff8:7cff:81f1:4c03:f000:7f08:7c4e,
}
```
