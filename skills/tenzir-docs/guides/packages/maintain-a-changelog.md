# Maintain a changelog


This guide shows you how to manage changelog entries and publish releases with [`tenzir-ship`](/reference/ship-framework.md). You’ll learn the complete workflow from adding your first entry to publishing a release on GitHub.

## Prerequisites

* Python 3.12 or newer
* [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) installed locally
* Access to the repository that hosts the changelog files

## Quick start

Initialize the changelog project:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship init
```

The `init` command scaffolds a `changelog/` subdirectory for standalone projects, writes `config.yaml`, and creates `unreleased/`. In repositories that already expose `package.yaml` next to `changelog/`, the CLI switches to package mode automatically and reuses the package `id` and `name` without creating an extra config file.

For non-interactive setup, pass `--yes`. Standalone mode requires an explicit project identifier:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship init --yes --id my-project
```

Then create your first changelog entry:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship add
```

The wizard will guide you through the process of creating a new changelog entry. It will ask you for the title, type, and description of the change, as well as the author. The first invocation of `add` can still bootstrap a missing changelog automatically, but `init` is the clearer entry point when you only want to set up the workspace.

View the current changelog for your working tree:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship show
```

The default table lists every entry with row numbers, making it easy to reference specific items. Row numbers count backward from the newest entry, so `#1` always targets the latest change.

Inspect a card layout with `uvx tenzir-ship show --card 1` or export release notes with `uvx tenzir-ship show v0.2.0 --release --markdown`.

Add entries as you prepare pull requests:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship add \
  --title "Introduce pipeline builder" \
  --type feature \
  --pr 101
```

Pass flags for authors, projects, and descriptions to avoid interactive prompts, or provide the details interactively when prompted—there is no GitHub auto-detection.

## Daily development workflow

These tasks cover the most common operations you’ll perform while working on pull requests and reviewing pending changes.

### Add entries for pull requests

Run `uvx tenzir-ship add` while preparing pull requests to capture changes:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship add \
  --title "Fix authentication timeout" \
  --type bugfix \
  --description "Resolves session expiry issue." \
  --pr 102
```

The CLI prompts for missing information interactively. Use one-key shortcuts for change types: `0` for breaking, `1` for feature, `2` for bugfix, `3` for change.

### Add co-authors

Use `--co-author` to credit additional contributors alongside the automatically inferred author:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship add \
  --title "Implement caching layer" \
  --type feature \
  --co-author claude
```

This is ideal for AI-assisted development, pair programming, or collaborative contributions. The CLI infers the primary author from environment variables or the GitHub CLI, then appends co-authors in the order you specify:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship add \
  --title "Refactor authentication" \
  --type change \
  --co-author claude \
  --co-author copilot \
  --pr 150
```

You can also combine `--author` with `--co-author` to set the primary author explicitly:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship add \
  --title "Fix race condition" \
  --type bugfix \
  --author alice \
  --co-author bob
```

### View pending changes

List all unreleased entries:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship show unreleased
```

Show detailed information for a specific entry:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship show --card 1
```

The card view displays detailed metadata and the full entry body:

```text
❯ tenzir-ship show --card 1
╭─ 🐞 Normalize release note paragraphs ───────────────────────────────────╮
│ Entry ID:  normalize-release-note-paragraphs                             │
│ Type:      bugfix                                                        │
│ Created:   2025-10-27                                                    │
│ Authors:   @codex                                                        │
│ Status:    Released in v0.4.1                                            │

╰──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────╯
```

Filter by project when working with multiple projects:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship show --project core
```

### Validate changelog structure

Run validation checks to catch issues early:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship validate
```

The validator reports missing metadata, unused entries, duplicate entry IDs, and configuration drift. It also checks changelog directory layout and flags stray items (for example an unexpected `changelog/next/` directory). Add this to CI pipelines to enforce metadata completeness.

### View project statistics

Get an overview of your project’s release history and entry distribution:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship stats
```

Single projects show a vertical card layout with sections for project metadata, releases, entry types, and status. Multi-module projects display a compact table comparing all modules.

Export statistics as JSON for automation:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship stats --json
```

## Release workflow

Once you’ve accumulated unreleased entries, you can cut a release, export notes, and publish to GitHub.

### Create a release

Preview the release before committing changes:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship release create
```

The command shows which entries will be included and performs a dry run. When the summary looks good, re-run with `--yes` to commit the changes:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship release create --yes
```

This auto-bumps the version from the unreleased entry types, creates `releases/<resolved-version>/`, generates `notes.md`, and updates `manifest.yaml`.

The `--patch`, `--minor`, and `--major` shortcuts resolve from the latest stable release. The same stable-only rule applies to `show latest`, and `release version`. In contrast, `release publish` without a version targets the latest release, including release candidates.

By default, `release create` also updates common package-manager version files (`package.json`, `pyproject.toml`, `project.toml`, `Cargo.toml`) when present in the changelog root or, for `changelog/` projects, in the parent directory. For advanced repositories with custom release scripts, disable built-in bumps in `config.yaml`:

```yaml
release:
  version_bump_mode: off
```

If changelog structure is invalid, `release create` and `release publish` fail fast with detailed errors. Other commands emit warnings so you can fix layout problems before cutting a release.

Use version bump shortcuts instead of typing the full version:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship release create --patch --yes
uvx tenzir-ship release create --minor --yes
uvx tenzir-ship release create --major --yes
```

Use these manual bump flags only when the automatic detection is not the right fit for the release.

Pass an explicit stable version only as a rare exact override, for example when you need to re-cut a failed tagged release or match an externally dictated version:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship release create v5.4.0 --yes
```

Add an inline intro summary:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship release create \
  --intro "Major stability improvements." \
  --yes
```

Alternatively, provide intro content from a file:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship release create \
  --intro-file intro.md \
  --yes
```

The intro file can include Markdown links, call-outs, or image references. The command embeds its content in `manifest.yaml` and includes it in `notes.md`.

### Create a release candidate

Create or continue a release candidate with:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship release create --rc --yes
```

This snapshots the current `unreleased/` queue into a `vX.Y.Z-rc.N` release without consuming those entry files. You can re-run the command to continue the same RC series while you iterate on the release.

To steer the inferred base version, prefer a manual bump such as `release create --rc --minor`. Pass an explicit stable version only when you need an exact base:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship release create v5.4.0 --rc --yes
```

### Promote an existing release candidate

Once release candidates exist for a stable target, keep the workflow on that series:

```sh
# Continue the RC series
uvx tenzir-ship release create --rc --yes


# Promote the latest release candidate automatically
uvx tenzir-ship release create --yes
```

Use the plain version-less command as the default follow-up to `--rc`. Avoid explicit stable versions and manual bump flags while an RC is outstanding. They add room for mistakes, and the CLI rejects them.

### Export release notes

Export release notes for a specific version:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship show v5.4.0 --release --markdown
```

Export as JSON for programmatic use:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship show v5.4.0 --release --json
```

Use compact format for bullet-list layout:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship show v5.4.0 --release --compact --markdown
```

Preview unreleased entries as if they were already released:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship show unreleased --release --markdown
```

Export all releases in a single invocation for batch processing:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship show all --release --json
```

This exports every release as a JSON array, useful for documentation sync scripts that need all release data at once.

To render the latest stable release without spelling out the version, use:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship show latest --release --markdown
```

This resolves the newest stable release only. Release candidates never replace `latest`.

### Publish to GitHub

Publish directly from the changelog project using the CLI:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship release publish --yes
```

Include tagging and pushing via the CLI:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship release publish --tag --yes
```

If you do pass a version, `tenzir-ship` publishes that exact release:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship release publish v5.4.0 --yes
```

Draft or prerelease variants:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship release publish v5.4.0 --draft --yes
uvx tenzir-ship release publish v5.4.0 --prerelease --yes
```

When you publish `vX.Y.Z-rc.N`, `tenzir-ship` automatically creates a GitHub prerelease and prevents GitHub from marking it as the latest release. You don’t need to add `--prerelease` or `--no-latest` for RC tags. Because version-less publish now targets the latest release, the same command works after both stable releases and RCs.

### Trigger the bundled GitHub Actions workflow

If you want to cut releases from GitHub Actions, start by adding a workflow file to your repository:

.github/workflows/release.yaml

```yaml
name: Release


on:
  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      bump:
        description: Version bump type
        required: false
        default: auto
        type: choice
        options:
          - auto
          - minor
          - patch
          - major
      version:
        description: Explicit stable version override
        required: false
        type: string
      rc:
        description: Create or continue the release-candidate series
        required: false
        default: false
        type: boolean
      intro:
        description: 1-2 sentence release introduction
        required: true
        type: string
      title:
        description: User-facing release title
        required: false
        type: string


jobs:
  release:
    uses: tenzir/ship/.github/workflows/reusable-release.yaml@<version>
    with:
      bump: ${{ inputs.bump }}
      version: ${{ inputs.version }}
      rc: ${{ inputs.rc }}
      intro: ${{ inputs.intro }}
      title: ${{ inputs.title }}
    secrets: inherit
```

Replace `<version>` with the `tenzir-ship` release tag you want to pin to, for example `v1.5.0`. Add the advanced inputs from the reference page only when your repository needs them.

That `release.yaml` wrapper mirrors the CLI options. Use `rc: true` to create or continue a release-candidate series:

```sh
gh workflow run release.yaml \
  -f intro="Preview the upcoming release." \
  -f title="Release candidate" \
  -f rc=true
```

When an RC is already outstanding, trigger the same workflow without `rc` to promote the latest candidate automatically:

```sh
gh workflow run release.yaml \
  -f intro="Ship the latest release candidate." \
  -f title="Stable release" \
  # no rc flag here
```

Terminology

We use the verb “publish” in prose even though the GitHub CLI subcommand to create a release is `gh release create`. If you created a draft first, you can publish it with `gh release edit v5.4.0 --draft=false`.

## End-to-end Walkthrough

This walkthrough shows how to initialize a repository, add entries, preview the backlog, and publish a release manifest with custom introductory content.

### Create a project

Initialize a new changelog project from your project root:

```sh
cd my-project
uvx tenzir-ship add \
  --title "Add pipeline builder" \
  --type feature \
  --description "Introduces the new pipeline builder UI." \
  --author alice \
  --pr 101
```

The first `add` invocation scaffolds the project automatically, creating a `changelog/` subdirectory—no manual config editing needed. After the command completes, inspect `changelog/config.yaml` (or update `package.yaml` if you’re using the package layout):

```yaml
id: my-project
name: My Project
```

### Capture entries

Record additional changes with authors and pull request numbers:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship add \
  --title "Fix ingest crash" \
  --type bugfix \
  --description "Resolves ingest worker crash when tokens expire." \
  --author bob \
  --pr 102 \
  --pr 115


uvx tenzir-ship add \
  --title "Improve CLI help" \
  --type change \
  --description "Tweaks command descriptions for clarity." \
  --author carol \
  --pr 103
```

Each invocation writes a Markdown file inside `changelog/unreleased/`. For example, `add-pipeline-builder.md` looks like:

```markdown
---
title: Add pipeline builder
type: feature
author: alice
created: 2025-10-16T09:30:00Z
pr: 101
---


Introduces the new pipeline builder UI.
```

You can use either singular (`author`, `pr`, `component`) or plural (`authors`, `prs`, `components`) keys. The singular form is shorthand for single values.

If an entry spans multiple pull requests, repeat `--pr` during `add`. The CLI stores a `prs:` list in the generated frontmatter automatically.

### Preview the changelog

View all entries in table format:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship show
```

Inspect a detailed card for any entry:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship show --card 1
```

### Prepare release notes

Author an intro snippet that can include Markdown links, call-outs, or image references. Save it as `intro.md`:

```markdown
Welcome to the first release of the Tenzir changelog!


![Release Overview](images/release-overview.png)


We cover breaking changes, highlights, upgrades, and fixes below.
```

### Cut the release

Create the release with the custom intro file:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship release create v0.1.0 \
  --intro-file intro.md \
  --yes
```

The tool writes release artifacts under `releases/v0.1.0/`:

* `manifest.yaml` records the release date and intro:

  ```yaml
  created: 2025-10-18
  intro: |-
    Welcome to the first release of the Tenzir changelog!


    ![Release Overview](images/release-overview.png)


    We cover breaking changes, highlights, upgrades, and fixes below.
  ```

* `notes.md` stitches together the intro and generated sections:

  ```markdown
  Welcome to the first release of the Tenzir changelog!


  ![Release Overview](images/release-overview.png)


  We cover breaking changes, highlights, upgrades, and fixes below.


  ## Features


  - **Add pipeline builder**: Introduces the new pipeline builder UI.


  ## Bug fixes


  - **Fix ingest crash**: Resolves ingest worker crash when tokens expire.


  ## Changes


  - **Improve CLI help**: Tweaks command descriptions for clarity.
  ```

* `entries/` contains the archived entry files moved from `unreleased/`.

### Validate the project

Verify everything is correct:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship validate
```

A clean run prints `All changelog files look good!`. You can remove `intro.md` now that its content is embedded in the release file.

### Export the release

Print the release notes:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship show v0.1.0 --release --markdown
```

Export as JSON for programmatic use:

```sh
uvx tenzir-ship show v0.1.0 --release --json
```
