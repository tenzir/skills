# Fetch via HTTP and APIs


This guide shows you how to fetch data from HTTP APIs using the [`from_http`](/reference/operators/from_http.md) and [`http`](/reference/operators/http.md) operators. You’ll learn to make GET requests, handle authentication, and implement pagination for large result sets.

## Basic API Requests

Start with these fundamental patterns for making HTTP requests to APIs.

### Simple GET Requests

To fetch data from an API endpoint, pass the URL as the first parameter to the `from_http` operator:

```tql
from_http "https://api.example.com/data"
```

The operator makes a GET request by default and forwards the response as an event. The `from_http` operator is an input operator, i.e., it starts a pipeline. The companion operator `http` is a transformation, allowing you to specify the URL as a field by referencing an event field that contains the URL:

```tql
from {url: "https://api.example.com/data"}
http url
```

This pattern is useful when processing multiple URLs or when URLs are generated dynamically. Most of our subsequent examples use `from_http`, as the operator options are very similar.

### Parsing the HTTP Response Body

The `from_http` and `http` operators automatically determine how to parse the HTTP response body using multiple methods:

1. **URL-based inference**: The operators first check the URL’s file extension to infer both the format (JSON, CSV, Parquet, etc.) and compression type (gzip, zstd, etc.). This works just like the generic `from` operator.

2. **Header-based inference**: If the format cannot be determined from the URL, the operators fall back to using the HTTP `Content-Type` and `Content-Encoding` response headers.

3. **Manual specification**: You can always override automatic inference by providing a parsing pipeline.

#### Automatic Format and Compression Inference

When the URL contains a recognizable file extension, the operators automatically handle decompression and parsing:

```tql
from_http "https://example.org/data/events.csv.zst"
```

This automatically infers `zstd` compression and `CSV` format from the file extension, decompresses, and parses accordingly.

For URLs without clear extensions, the operators use HTTP headers:

```tql
from_http "https://example.org/download"
```

If the server responds with `Content-Type: application/json` and `Content-Encoding: gzip`, the operator will decompress and parse as JSON.

#### Manual Format Specification

You can manually override the parser for the response body by specifying a parsing pipeline, i.e., a pipeline that transforms bytes to events. For example, if an API returns CSV data without a proper `Content-Type`, you can specify the parsing pipeline as follows:

```tql
from_http "https://api.example.com/users" {
  read_csv
}
```

This parses the response from CSV into structured events that you can process further.

Similarly, if you need to handle specific compression and format combinations that aren’t automatically detected:

```tql
from_http "https://example.org/archive" {
  decompress_gzip
  read_json
}
```

This explicitly specifies to decompress gzip and then parse as JSON, regardless of the URL or HTTP headers.

### POST Requests with Data

Send data to APIs by specifying the `method` parameter as “post” and providing the request body in the `body` parameter:

```tql
from_http "https://api.example.com/users",
  method="post",
  body={"name": "John", "email": "john@example.com"}
```

Similarly, with the `http` operator you can also parameterize the entire HTTP request using event fields by referencing field values for each parameter:

```tql
from {
  url: "https://api.example.com/users",
  method: "post",
  data: {
    name: "John",
    email: "john@example.com"
  }
}
http url, method=method, body=data
```

The operators automatically use POST method when you specify a body.

## Request Configuration

Configure requests with headers, authentication, and other options for different API requirements.

### Adding Headers

Include custom headers by providing the `headers` parameter as a record containing key-value pairs:

```tql
from_http "https://api.example.com/data", headers={
    "Authorization": "Bearer " + secret("YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN")
  }
```

Headers help you authenticate with APIs and specify request formats. Use the [`secret`](/reference/functions/secret.md) function to retrieve sensitive API tokens, as in the above example.

### TLS and Security

Enable TLS by setting the `tls` parameter to `true` and configure client certificates using the `certfile` and `keyfile` parameters:

```tql
from_http "https://secure-api.example.com/data",
  tls=true,
  certfile="/path/to/client.crt",
  keyfile="/path/to/client.key"
```

Use these options when APIs require client certificate authentication.

### Timeout and Retry Configuration

Configure timeouts and retry behavior by setting the `connection_timeout`, `max_retry_count`, and `retry_delay` parameters:

```tql
from_http "https://api.example.com/data",
  timeout=10s,
  max_retries=3,
  retry_delay=2s
```

These settings help handle network issues and API rate limiting gracefully.

## Data Enrichment

Use HTTP requests to enrich existing data with information from external APIs.

### Preserving Input Context

Keep original event data while adding API responses by specifying the `response_field` parameter to control where the response is stored:

```tql
from {
  domain: "example.com",
  severity: "HIGH",
  api_url: "https://threat-intel.example.com/lookup",
  response_field: "threat_data",
}
http f"{api_url}?domain={domain}", response_field=response_field
```

This approach preserves your original data and adds API responses in a specific field.

### Adding Metadata

Capture HTTP response metadata by specifying the `metadata_field` parameter to store status codes and headers separately from the response body:

```tql
from_http "https://api.example.com/status", metadata_field=http_meta
```

The metadata includes status codes and response headers for debugging and monitoring.

## Pagination and Bulk Processing

Handle APIs that return large datasets across multiple pages.

### Lambda-Based Pagination

Implement automatic pagination by providing a lambda function to the `paginate` parameter that extracts the next page URL from the response:

```tql
from_http "https://api.example.com/search?q=query",
  paginate=(response => "next_page_url" if response.has_more)
```

The operator continues making requests as long as the pagination lambda function returns a valid URL.

### Complex Pagination Logic

Handle APIs with custom pagination schemes by building pagination URLs dynamically using expressions that reference response data:

```tql
let $base_url = "https://api.example.com/items"
from_http f"{$base_url}?page=1",
  paginate=(x => f"{$base_url}?page={x.page + 1}" if x.page < x.total_pages),
```

This example builds pagination URLs dynamically based on response data.

### Link Header Pagination

Many REST APIs (such as GitHub, GitLab, and Jira) include pagination URLs in the HTTP `Link` response header following [RFC 8288](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8288). Use `paginate="link"` to follow these automatically:

```tql
from_http "https://api.github.com/repos/tenzir/tenzir/issues?per_page=10",
  paginate="link"
```

The operator parses the `Link` header, finds the `rel=next` relation, and continues fetching pages until the response no longer includes a next link.

This works with any API that returns a header like:

```plaintext
Link: <https://api.example.com/items?page=2>; rel="next"
```

Relative URLs in the `Link` header are resolved against the request URL, so both absolute and relative pagination links work correctly.

The same approach works with the [`http`](/reference/operators/http.md) operator:

```tql
from {url: "https://api.github.com/repos/tenzir/tenzir/issues?per_page=10"}
http url, paginate="link"
```

### Rate Limiting

Control request frequency by configuring the `paginate_delay` parameter to add delays between requests and the `parallel` parameter to limit concurrent requests:

```tql
from {
  url: "https://api.example.com/data",
  paginate_delay: 500ms,
  parallel: 2
}
http url,
  paginate="next_url" if has_next,
  paginate_delay=paginate_delay,
  parallel=parallel
```

Use `paginate_delay` and `parallel` to manage request rates appropriately.

HTTP Pipelining

The `parallel` option effectively controls HTTP request pipelining. It exists only for the `http` operator, because unlike `from_http`, it can receive several events from its upstream operator, each of which fire off a new HTTP request. The corresponding responses may still be in transit before the next request arrives. With the `parallel` option, you specify the exact number of in-flight responses.

## Practical Examples

These examples demonstrate typical use cases for API integration in real-world scenarios.

### API Monitoring

Monitor API health and response times:

```tql
from_http "https://api.example.com/health", metadata_field=metadata
select date=metadata.headers.Date.parse_time("%a, %d %b %Y %H:%M:%S %Z")
latency = now() - date
```

The above example parses the `Date` header from the HTTP response via [`parse_time`](/reference/functions/parse_time.md) into a timestamp and then compares it to the current wallclock time using the [`now`](/reference/functions/now.md) function.

Nit: `%T` is a shortcut for `%H:%M:%S`.

## Error Handling

Handle API errors and failures gracefully in your data pipelines.

### Retry Configuration

Configure automatic retries by setting the `max_retry_count` parameter to specify the number of retry attempts and `retry_delay` to control the time between retries:

```tql
from_http "https://unreliable-api.example.com/data",
  max_retries=5,
  retry_delay=2s
```

### Status Code Handling

Check HTTP status codes by capturing metadata and filtering based on the `code` field to handle different response types:

```tql
from_http "https://api.example.com/data", metadata_field=metadata
where metadata.code >= 200 and metadata.code < 300
```

## Best Practices

Follow these practices for reliable and efficient API integration:

1. **Use appropriate timeouts**. Set a reasonable `connection_timeout` for your use case.
2. **Implement retry logic**. Configure `max_retry_count` and `retry_delay` for handling transient failures.
3. **Respect rate limits**. Use `parallel` and `paginate_delay` to control request rates.
4. **Handle errors gracefully**. Check status codes in metadata (`metadata_field`) and implement fallback logic.
5. **Secure credentials**. Access API keys and tokens via [secrets](../../explanations/secrets.md), not in code.
6. **Monitor API usage**. Track response times and error rates for performance.
7. **Leverage automatic format inference**. Use descriptive file extensions in URLs when possible to enable automatic format and compression detection.
8. **Prefer link pagination when available**. Use `paginate="link"` for APIs that support RFC 8288 `Link` headers instead of writing custom lambda expressions.
