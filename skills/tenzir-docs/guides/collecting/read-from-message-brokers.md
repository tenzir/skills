# Read from message brokers


This guide shows you how to receive events from message brokers using TQL. You’ll learn to subscribe to topics and queues from Apache Kafka (including Amazon MSK), NATS JetStream, AMQP-based brokers (like RabbitMQ), Amazon SQS, and Google Cloud Pub/Sub.

## Apache Kafka

[Apache Kafka](../../integrations/kafka.md) is a distributed message broker commonly used for high-throughput event streaming. Use `from_kafka` to subscribe to topics.

### Subscribe to a topic

```tql
from_kafka "security-events"
```

By default, `from_kafka` produces events with the raw message in a `message` field. Parse the message content to extract structured data:

```tql
from_kafka "security-events"
this = message.parse_json()
```

### Control the read offset

The `offset` option determines where to start reading:

| Value         | Description                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `"beginning"` | Start from the oldest available message |
| `"end"`       | Start from the newest messages only     |
| `"stored"`    | Resume from the last committed offset   |
| `1000`        | Start from a specific offset            |
| `-100`        | Start 100 messages before the end       |

```tql
from_kafka "events", offset="beginning"
```

### Configure consumer groups

Kafka uses consumer groups to distribute messages across multiple consumers. Specify a group ID for coordinated consumption:

```tql
from_kafka "events", group_id="tenzir-ingest"
```

### Connect to Amazon MSK

[Amazon MSK](../../integrations/amazon/msk.md) is a managed Kafka service. Use the `aws_iam` option for IAM authentication:

```tql
from_kafka "security-logs",
  options={"bootstrap.servers": "my-cluster.kafka.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:9098"},
  aws_iam={region: "us-east-1"}
```

## NATS JetStream

[NATS](../../integrations/nats.md) is a messaging system for services, edge deployments, and cloud-native applications. Use `from_nats` to consume messages from JetStream subjects.

### Consume from a subject

```tql
from_nats "alerts", durable="tenzir-alerts"
this = string(message).parse_json()
```

The NATS server must have a JetStream stream that captures the subject you consume from.

### Preserve message metadata

Use `metadata_field` to copy NATS metadata into events:

```tql
from_nats "alerts", metadata_field=nats
parsed = string(message).parse_json()
nats_subject = nats.subject
nats_stream = nats.stream
nats_sequence = nats.stream_sequence
```

## AMQP (RabbitMQ)

[AMQP](../../integrations/amqp.md) is supported by brokers such as RabbitMQ. Use `from_amqp` directly with AMQP URLs.

### Receive from a queue

```tql
from_amqp "amqp://user:pass@broker:5672/vhost", queue="events"
this = string(message).parse_json()
```

The URL structure is `amqp://user:password@host:port/vhost`. Configure additional options like `exchange`, `routing_key`, and `queue` in the operator parameters. The operator emits each AMQP payload in the `message` field.

## Amazon SQS

[Amazon SQS](../../integrations/amazon/sqs.md) is a managed message queue. Use `from_amazon_sqs` to receive events from SQS queues.

### Receive from a queue

```tql
from_amazon_sqs "sqs://my-queue"
this = message.parse_json()
```

### Configure polling

Use long polling to reduce empty responses, and set `batch_size` to control the maximum number of messages per receive request:

```tql
from_amazon_sqs "sqs://my-queue", poll_time=5s, batch_size=10
```

By default, Tenzir deletes each SQS message after emitting it. Set `keep_messages=true` to leave messages in the queue so SQS makes them visible again after the queue’s visibility timeout:

```tql
from_amazon_sqs "sqs://my-queue", keep_messages=true, visibility_timeout=30s
```

## Google Cloud Pub/Sub

[Google Cloud Pub/Sub](../../integrations/google/cloud-pubsub.md) provides managed messaging for Google Cloud. Use `from_google_cloud_pubsub` to subscribe.

### Receive from a subscription

```tql
from_google_cloud_pubsub project_id="my-project",
  subscription_id="my-subscription"
parsed = message.parse_json()
```

The operator produces events with a `message` field containing the raw message content. Parse it to extract structured data.
