# Read from message brokers


This guide shows you how to receive events from message brokers using TQL. You’ll learn to subscribe to topics and queues from Apache Kafka (including Amazon MSK), AMQP-based brokers (like RabbitMQ), Amazon SQS, and Google Cloud Pub/Sub.

## Apache Kafka

[Apache Kafka](../../integrations/kafka.md) is a distributed message broker commonly used for high-throughput event streaming. Use [`from_kafka`](../../reference/operators/from_kafka.md) to subscribe to topics.

### Subscribe to a topic

```tql
from_kafka "security-events"
```

By default, `from_kafka` produces events with the raw message in a `message` field. Parse the message content to extract structured data:

```tql
from_kafka "security-events"
this = message.parse_json()
```

### Control the read offset

The `offset` option determines where to start reading:

| Value         | Description                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| `"beginning"` | Start from the oldest available message |
| `"end"`       | Start from the newest messages only     |
| `"stored"`    | Resume from the last committed offset   |
| `1000`        | Start from a specific offset            |
| `-100`        | Start 100 messages before the end       |

```tql
from_kafka "events", offset="beginning"
```

### Configure consumer groups

Kafka uses consumer groups to distribute messages across multiple consumers. Specify a group ID for coordinated consumption:

```tql
from_kafka "events", group_id="tenzir-ingest"
```

### Connect to Amazon MSK

[Amazon MSK](../../integrations/amazon/msk.md) is a managed Kafka service. Use the `aws_iam` option for IAM authentication:

```tql
from_kafka "security-logs",
  options={"bootstrap.servers": "my-cluster.kafka.us-east-1.amazonaws.com:9098"},
  aws_iam={region: "us-east-1"}
```

## AMQP (RabbitMQ)

[AMQP](../../integrations/amqp.md) is supported by brokers like RabbitMQ. Use AMQP URLs with [`from`](../../reference/operators/from.md) or [`load_amqp`](../../reference/operators/load_amqp.md) directly.

### Receive from a queue

```tql
from "amqp://user:pass@broker:5672/vhost"
```

The URL structure is `amqp://user:password@host:port/vhost`. Configure additional options like exchange and routing key in the operator parameters.

## Amazon SQS

[Amazon SQS](../../integrations/amazon/sqs.md) is a managed message queue. Use [`load_sqs`](../../reference/operators/load_sqs.md) or the `sqs://` URL scheme.

### Receive from a queue

```tql
from "sqs://my-queue" {
  read_json
}
```

### Configure polling

Use long polling to reduce API calls and receive messages in batches:

```tql
from "sqs://my-queue", poll_interval=5s {
  read_json
}
```

SQS automatically deletes messages after successful receipt.

## Google Cloud Pub/Sub

[Google Cloud Pub/Sub](../../integrations/google/cloud-pubsub.md) provides managed messaging for Google Cloud. Use [`from_google_cloud_pubsub`](../../reference/operators/from_google_cloud_pubsub.md) to subscribe.

### Receive from a subscription

```tql
from_google_cloud_pubsub project_id="my-project",
  subscription_id="my-subscription"
parsed = message.parse_json()
```

The operator produces events with a `message` field containing the raw message content. Parse it to extract structured data.
