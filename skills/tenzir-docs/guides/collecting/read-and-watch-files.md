# Read and watch files


This guide shows you how to read files and monitor directories using the [`from_file`](../../reference/operators/from_file.md) operator. You’ll learn to read individual files, batch process directories, and set up real-time file monitoring.

Transitioning from legacy operators

We designed the [`from_file`](../../reference/operators/from_file.md) operator to replace the existing [`load_file`](../../reference/operators/load_file.md), [`load_s3`](../../reference/operators/load_s3.md), and [`load_gcs`](../../reference/operators/load_gcs.md) operators. While we still support these legacy operators, [`from_file`](../../reference/operators/from_file.md) provides a more unified and feature-rich approach to file ingestion.

We plan to add some advanced features from the legacy operators (such as file tailing, anonymous S3 access, and Unix domain socket support) in future releases of [`from_file`](../../reference/operators/from_file.md).

## Basic file reading

The [`from_file`](../../reference/operators/from_file.md) operator handles various file types and formats. Start with these fundamental patterns for reading individual files.

### Single files

To read a single file, specify the path to the [`from_file`](../../reference/operators/from_file.md) operator:

```tql
from_file "/path/to/file.json"
```

The operator automatically detects the file format from the file extension. This works for all supported formats including JSON, CSV, Parquet, and others.

### Compressed files

The operator handles compressed files automatically. You need no additional configuration:

```tql
from_file "/path/to/file.csv.gz"
```

Supported compression formats include gzip, bzip2, and Zstd.

### Custom parsing

When automatic format detection doesn’t suffice, specify a custom [parsing](../../reference/operators.md#parsing) pipeline:

```tql
from_file "/path/to/file.log" {
  read_syslog
}
```

The parsing pipeline runs on the file content and must return events.

## Directory processing

You can process multiple files efficiently using glob patterns. This section covers batch processing and recursive directory operations.

### Processing multiple files

Use glob patterns to process multiple files at once:

```tql
from_file "/path/to/directory/*.csv.zst"
```

This example processes all Zstd-compressed CSV files in the specified directory.

You can also use glob patterns to consume files regardless of their format:

```tql
from_file "~/data/**"
```

This processes all files in the `~/data` directory and its subdirectories, automatically detecting and parsing each file format.

### Recursive directory processing

Use `**` to match files recursively through subdirectories:

```tql
from_file "/path/to/directory/**.csv"
```

### Custom parsing for multiple files

When you process multiple files with custom parsing, the pipeline runs separately for each file:

```tql
from_file "/path/to/directory/*.log" {
  read_lines
}
```

### Batch data processing

Process all files in a data directory using recursive globbing:

```tql
from_file "/data/exports/**.parquet"
```

## File monitoring

Set up real-time file processing by monitoring directories for changes. These features enable continuous data ingestion workflows.

### Watch for new files

Use the `watch` parameter to monitor a directory for new files:

```tql
from_file "/path/to/directory/*.csv", watch=true
```

This sets up continuous monitoring, processing new files as they appear in the directory.

### Remove files after processing

Combine watching with automatic file removal using the `remove` parameter:

```tql
from_file "/path/to/directory/*.csv", watch=true, remove=true
```

This approach helps you implement file-based queues where the system should automatically clean up processed files.

### Real-time log processing

Monitor a log directory and process files as they arrive:

```tql
from_file "/var/log/application/*.log", watch=true {
  read_lines
}
```

### Archive processing with cleanup

Process archived data and remove files after successful ingestion:

```tql
from_file "/archive/*.csv.gz", remove=true
```

## Cloud storage integration

Access files directly from cloud storage providers using their native URLs. The operator supports major cloud platforms transparently.

### Amazon S3

Access [S3](../../integrations/amazon/s3.md) buckets directly using `s3://` URLs:

```tql
from_file "s3://bucket/path/to/file.csv"
```

Glob patterns work with S3 as well:

```tql
from_file "s3://bucket/data/**/*.parquet"
```

### Google Cloud Storage

Access [GCS](../../integrations/google/cloud-storage.md) buckets using `gs://` URLs:

```tql
from_file "gs://bucket/path/to/file.csv"
```

### Azure Blob Storage

Access [Azure Blob Storage](../../integrations/microsoft/azure-blob-storage.md) using `abfs://` URLs:

```tql
from_file "abfs://container/path/to/file.csv"
```

Glob patterns work with Azure Blob Storage as well:

```tql
from_file "abfs://container/data/**/*.parquet"
```

Cloud storage integration uses Apache Arrow’s filesystem APIs and supports the same glob patterns and options as local files, including recursive globbing across cloud storage hierarchies.
