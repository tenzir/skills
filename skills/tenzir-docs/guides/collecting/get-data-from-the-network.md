# Get data from the network


This guide shows you how to receive data directly from network sources using TQL. You’ll learn to listen on TCP and UDP sockets for incoming data and capture raw packets from network interfaces.

## TCP sockets

The [Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)](../../integrations/tcp.md) provides reliable, ordered byte streams. Use TCP when you need guaranteed delivery and message ordering.

### Listen for connections

Start a TCP server that accepts incoming connections:

```tql
from "tcp://0.0.0.0:9000" {
  read_json
}
```

This listens on all interfaces (`0.0.0.0`) on port 9000. Specify a parsing pipeline to convert incoming bytes to events.

### Connect to a remote server

Act as a TCP client by connecting to an existing server:

```tql
from "tcp://192.168.1.100:9000", connect=true {
  read_json
}
```

### Enable TLS

Secure your TCP connections with TLS by passing a `tls` record:

```tql
from "tcp://0.0.0.0:9443", tls={certfile: "cert.pem", keyfile: "key.pem"} {
  read_json
}
```

For testing, generate certificates with trustme:

```bash
uv run --with trustme python -m trustme
```

For production TLS configuration, including mutual TLS and cipher settings, see [Configure TLS](../node-setup/configure-tls.md).

## UDP sockets

The [User Datagram Protocol (UDP)](../../integrations/udp.md) is a connectionless protocol ideal for high-volume, loss-tolerant data like syslog messages or metrics.

### Receive UDP datagrams

Use [`from_udp`](/reference/operators/from_udp.md) to receive UDP messages as structured events:

```tql
from_udp "0.0.0.0:514"
```

Each datagram becomes an event with `data` (the message content) and `peer` (the sender’s address) fields.

### Parse syslog messages

A common pattern is receiving syslog over UDP:

```tql
from_udp "0.0.0.0:514"
this = data.parse_syslog()
```

### Enrich with sender metadata

Include the sender’s IP address and collection timestamp in your events:

```tql
from_udp "0.0.0.0:514"
syslog = data.parse_syslog()
this = {
  ...syslog,
  collector: {
    source_ip: peer.ip(),
    received_at: now(),
  },
}
```

## Packet capture

Capture raw network packets from a [network interface card (NIC)](../../integrations/nic.md) for deep packet inspection or network forensics.

### List available interfaces

Find which network interfaces are available:

```tql
nics
select name, addresses, up
where up
```

```tql
{name: "eth0", addresses: ["192.168.1.100", "fe80::1"], up: true}
{name: "lo", addresses: ["127.0.0.1", "::1"], up: true}
```

### Capture packets

Use `from_nic` to capture and parse packets:

```tql
from_nic "eth0" {
  read_pcap
}
```

Each packet becomes an event with metadata and the raw packet data:

```tql
{
  linktype: 1,
  timestamp: 2024-01-15T10:30:45.123456Z,
  captured_packet_length: 74,
  original_packet_length: 74,
  data: "ABY88f1tZJ7zvttmCABFAAA8...",
}
```

### Decapsulate packets

Extract protocol headers from captured packets using the [`decapsulate`](/reference/functions/decapsulate.md) function:

```tql
from_nic "eth0" {
  read_pcap
}
packet = decapsulate(this)
select packet
```

```tql
{
  packet: {
    ether: {src: "64-9E-F3-BE-DB-66", dst: "00-16-3C-F1-FD-6D", type: 2048},
    ip: {src: "192.168.1.100", dst: "10.0.0.1", type: 6},
    tcp: {src_port: 54321, dst_port: 443},
    community_id: "1:YXWfTYEyYLKVv5Ge4WqijUnKTrM=",
  },
}
```

The `community_id` field provides a [Community ID](https://github.com/corelight/community-id-spec) hash for correlating network flows across different tools.

### Filter by BPF expression

Apply Berkeley Packet Filter (BPF) expressions to capture only specific traffic:

```tql
from_nic filter="tcp port 443", "eth0" {
  read_pcap
}
```

### Read PCAP files

The same parsing works for PCAP files:

```tql
from_file "capture.pcap" {
  read_pcap
}
packet = decapsulate(this)
```

### Extract flow summaries

Capture packets and extract flow-level summaries:

```tql
from_nic "eth0" {
  read_pcap
}
packet = decapsulate(this)
select
  timestamp,
  src_ip=packet.ip.src,
  dst_ip=packet.ip.dst,
  src_port=packet.tcp.src_port? else packet.udp.src_port?,
  dst_port=packet.tcp.dst_port? else packet.udp.dst_port?,
  community_id=packet.community_id
```
