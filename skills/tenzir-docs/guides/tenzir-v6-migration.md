# Tenzir v6 Migration

> Learn how to migrate legacy TQL pipelines to Tenzir v6, adopt the new execution patterns, and use temporary compatibility controls while you update.


This guide shows you how to migrate legacy TQL pipelines to Tenzir v6. For most pipelines, the upgrade is small: many pipelines keep working as-is, and others need only a few local updates to sources and sinks. The sections that follow help you find the pipelines that do need attention and update them without changing the intent of your data flow.

Starting with the Tenzir v6 release candidate, the new engine is the default for pipelines. The legacy engine is still available during a temporary migration window, but it is deprecated in v6 and will be removed after the window closes.

Temporary compatibility controls

The legacy engine is deprecated in Tenzir v6. Use `//neo:false` as the first line only to keep critical existing pipelines running while you migrate. If you need to migrate one pipeline at a time, set `neo: false` temporarily and add `// neo` to pipelines after you update them.

## Choose a migration mode

Choose one migration mode for your upgrade:

* **Default opt-out**: Keep the v6 default. Pipelines use the new engine, and you fix failing pipelines as you find them. If an existing critical pipeline cannot be migrated immediately, add `//neo:false` temporarily.
* **Controlled opt-in**: Set `neo: false` in your settings so the legacy engine remains the default during your migration. Add `// neo` to individual pipelines after you update and test them. This reduces the blast radius, but you must track the pipelines that still need migration.

Use compatibility mode only while you migrate. It buys time, but it is not a long-term migration strategy.

## Temporary compatibility controls

Starting with the Tenzir v6 RC, you can temporarily keep the legacy engine as the default by explicitly setting `neo: false` in your node configuration:

```yaml
neo: false
```

With `neo: false`, opt individual migrated pipelines into the new engine by placing `// neo` on the first line of the pipeline definition:

```tql
// neo
from_http "https://api.example.com/events" {
  read_ndjson
}
import
```

If you keep the v6 default, you can temporarily select the legacy engine for an existing critical pipeline by placing `//neo:false` on the first line:

```tql
//neo:false
load_http "https://api.example.com/events"
read_ndjson
import
```

The `// neo` and `//neo:false` comments must be the first line of the pipeline definition. Pipeline-level comments apply to every pipeline definition form, including saved pipelines, deployed pipelines, ad-hoc CLI pipelines, and API-submitted pipelines.

## Migration checklist

Use this checklist to plan the migration:

* Inventory existing pipelines.
* Choose a migration mode: default opt-out for faster migration, or controlled opt-in with `neo: false` for a smaller blast radius.
* Test pipelines against the Tenzir v6 RC.
* Find legacy-only syntax and operators.
* Replace legacy patterns with v6 patterns.
* Use `//neo:false` only for existing critical pipelines that need temporary continuity.
* If you use compatibility mode, track pipelines that still need `// neo`.
* Deploy and monitor migrated pipelines.

## New v6 execution patterns

The most important migration change is the move away from old byte-stream source and sink operators toward event-oriented operators with explicit subpipelines.

### Message-based sources and destinations

#### Sources

Message brokers now use event-based source operators. For example, [`from_amqp`](/reference/operators/from_amqp.md) emits one event per Kafka message with the message payload in the `message` field:

```tql
from_amqp "amqp://broker/vhost"
this = message.parse_json()
import
```

This differs from `load_amqp`, which exposed a byte stream and could lose message boundaries before the parser saw the data.

#### Destinations

Similarly, the respective sink operators now accept events directly, sending one message per event:

```tql
from { field: "value" }
to_amqp "amqp://broker/vhost", message=this.print_ndjson()
```

This differs from `save_amqp`, which expected a byte stream that it would send according to its chunking.

### Parsing and printing subpipelines

Operators that read or write bytes use subpipelines to keep transport and data format separate. Source operators such as [`from_http`](/reference/operators/from_http.md) and [`from_file`](/reference/operators/from_file.md) receive bytes and use a parsing subpipeline:

```tql
from_http "https://example.com/events.json.gz" {
  decompress_gzip
  read_ndjson
}
```

Sink operators such as [`to_tcp`](/reference/operators/to_tcp.md) and [`serve_tcp`](/reference/operators/serve_tcp.md) receive events and use a printing subpipeline:

```tql
export
to_tcp "collector.example.com:5044" {
  write_ndjson
}
```

### Per-event subpipelines

Use [`each`](/reference/operators/each.md) when every incoming event describes a separate job. The current input event is available as `$this`, and the nested pipeline starts with its own source:

```tql
from {url: "https://example.com/a.json"},
     {url: "https://example.com/b.json"}
each parallel=4 {
  from_http $this.url {
    read_json
  }
}
```

This is the v6-compatible pattern for old pipelines that used a transform such as `http` to start a per-event request from upstream values.

## Migration reference

Use the tables below to find the v6-compatible pattern for legacy syntax, operators, and pipeline patterns. The notes after each table explain when a replacement needs a parsing or printing subpipeline.

### Files and object storage

| Legacy operator           | Use in v6                                  |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `load_file`               | `from_file`                                |
| `load_s3`                 | `from_file` or `from_s3`                   |
| `load_gcs`                | `from_file` or `from_google_cloud_storage` |
| `load_azure_blob_storage` | `from_file` or `from_azure_blob_storage`   |
| `save_file`               | `to_file`                                  |
| `save_s3`                 | `to_file` or `to_s3`                       |
| `save_gcs`                | `to_file` or `to_google_cloud_storage`     |
| `save_azure_blob_storage` | `to_file` or `to_azure_blob_storage`       |

Prefer `from_file` and `to_file` for URI-style file access. Use provider-specific operators when you need provider-specific options. Put decompression, parsing, and printing in a subpipeline when automatic format detection is not enough.

### HTTP and message brokers

| Legacy operator            | Use in v6                  |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| `load_http`                | `from_http`                |
| `save_http`                | `to_http`                  |
| `load_kafka`               | `from_kafka`               |
| `save_kafka`               | `to_kafka`                 |
| `load_amqp`                | `from_amqp`                |
| `save_amqp`                | `to_amqp`                  |
| `load_sqs`                 | `from_amazon_sqs`          |
| `save_sqs`                 | `to_amazon_sqs`            |
| `load_google_cloud_pubsub` | `from_google_cloud_pubsub` |
| `save_google_cloud_pubsub` | `to_google_cloud_pubsub`   |

Use a parsing subpipeline with `from_http` when the response body contains encoded events. Use a printing subpipeline with `to_http` when you need to build the request body explicitly.

Kafka and message-broker sources preserve message boundaries. For example, `from_kafka` emits the payload in `message`, which you can parse with functions such as `parse_json`.

### Network transports

| Legacy operator or mode        | Use in v6    |
| ------------------------------ | ------------ |
| `load_tcp` client mode         | `from_tcp`   |
| `load_tcp` server mode         | `accept_tcp` |
| `save_tcp` client mode         | `to_tcp`     |
| `save_tcp` server-style fanout | `serve_tcp`  |
| `load_udp`                     | `accept_udp` |
| `save_udp`                     | `to_udp`     |
| `load_zmq`                     | `from_zmq`   |
| `save_zmq`                     | `to_zmq`     |
| `load_nic`                     | `from_nic`   |

Use `accept_tcp` when the pipeline should listen for incoming TCP connections, and `serve_tcp` when clients connect to receive pipeline output. Use parsing subpipelines for received bytes and printing subpipelines for outgoing bytes. `accept_udp` emits one event per datagram with the payload in `data`.

### Standard input and output

| Legacy operator | Use in v6    |
| --------------- | ------------ |
| `load_stdin`    | `from_stdin` |
| `save_stdout`   | `to_stdout`  |

Add a parsing subpipeline when reading encoded bytes from standard input. Add a printing subpipeline when writing encoded bytes to standard output.

### Changed patterns

| Legacy pattern                   | Use in v6                                  |
| -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| `http` as a per-event API call   | `each` with `from_http`                    |
| `from_http ..., metadata_field=` | `$response` inside the parsing subpipeline |
| `from_http ..., server=true`     | `accept_http`                              |

Use `each` when the nested work should start its own source for every input event. Keep `http` when you need to enrich the current event with an HTTP response. Listening for incoming HTTP requests is now handled by `accept_http`.

### Generic `from` URI routing

The old `from` operator (no suffix) accepted a URI and dispatched to the appropriate `load_*` operator based on the scheme. Use the table below to find the v6 operator for each URI scheme.

| URI scheme      | Use in v6                   |
| --------------- | --------------------------- |
| `abfs`, `abfss` | `from_azure_blob_storage`   |
| `amqp`          | `from_amqp`                 |
| `elasticsearch` | `from_opensearch`           |
| `file`          | `from_file`                 |
| `fluent-bit`    | `from_fluent_bit`           |
| `ftp`, `ftps`   | `from_ftp`                  |
| `gs`            | `from_google_cloud_storage` |
| `http`, `https` | `from_http`                 |
| `inproc`, `zmq` | `from_zmq`                  |
| `kafka`         | `from_kafka`                |
| `opensearch`    | `from_opensearch`           |
| `s3`            | `from_s3`                   |
| `sqs`           | `from_amazon_sqs`           |
| `tcp`           | `from_tcp` or `accept_tcp`  |
| `udp`           | `accept_udp`                |

Move any parsing steps that followed the old `from` call into a parsing subpipeline on the new operator. For TCP, use `from_tcp` when connecting to a remote endpoint and `accept_tcp` when listening for incoming connections.

### Generic `to` URI routing

The old `to` operator (no suffix) accepted a URI and dispatched to the appropriate `save_*` operator based on the scheme. Use the table below to find the v6 operator for each URI scheme.

| URI scheme                         | Use in v6                   |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------- |
| `abfs`, `abfss`                    | `to_azure_blob_storage`     |
| `amqp`                             | `to_amqp`                   |
| `elasticsearch`, `opensearch`      | `to_opensearch`             |
| `file`                             | `to_file`                   |
| `fluent-bit`                       | `to_fluent_bit`             |
| `ftp`, `ftps`                      | `to_ftp`                    |
| `gs`                               | `to_google_cloud_storage`   |
| `http`, `https`                    | `to_http`                   |
| `inproc`, `zmq`                    | `to_zmq`                    |
| `kafka`                            | `to_kafka`                  |
| `s3`                               | `to_s3`                     |
| `sqs`                              | `to_amazon_sqs`             |
| `tcp`                              | `to_tcp` or `serve_tcp`     |
| `udp`                              | `to_udp`                    |
| `smtp`, `smtps`, `mailto`, `email` | No replacement — see below. |

Move any printing steps that preceded the old `to` call into a printing subpipeline on the new operator. For TCP, use `to_tcp` when connecting to a remote endpoint and `serve_tcp` when clients connect to receive output. Email schemes (`smtp`, `smtps`, `mailto`, `email`) have no direct replacement; use the `python` or `shell` operator to send email instead.

### Removed without replacement

These items need redesign rather than a direct replacement:

| Removed item           | What to do instead                                     |
| ---------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `buffer`               | Remove it.                                             |
| `legacy`               | Rewrite the operation using the existing operators.    |
| `save_email`           | Use the `python` or `shell` operator to send an email. |
| Operator-level metrics | Monitor pipeline-level metrics instead.                |

### Message Broker Connectors

#### Kafka

Pre-existing operators

`from_kafka` and `to_kafka` were already introduced to the old execution engine in previous Tenzir Node versions. Both work largely the same on the new engine, except that `from_kafka` no longer accepts `commit_batch_size`.

##### Consume

Before:

```tql
load_kafka "security-events"
read_json
import
```

After:

```tql
from_kafka "security-events"
this = message.parse_json()
import
```

##### Produce

Before:

```tql
export
write_ndjson
save_kafka "security-events"
```

After:

```tql
export
to_kafka "security-events"
```

`to_kafka` sends one message per event and serializes it as NDJSON by default.

#### AMQP

##### Consume

Before:

```tql
load_amqp "amqp://user:pass@broker:5672/vhost", queue="events"
read_json
```

After:

```tql
from_amqp "amqp://user:pass@broker:5672/vhost", queue="events"
this = string(message).parse_json()
```

##### Produce

Before:

```tql
export
write_json
save_amqp "amqp://user:pass@broker:5672/vhost"
```

After:

```tql
export
to_amqp "amqp://user:pass@broker:5672/vhost"
```

`to_amqp` sends one message per event and serializes it as NDJSON by default. Use `message=` to send a custom expression instead.

Use the named AMQP and SQS operators for these brokers. Prefer those forms over generic URI routing when you update pipeline definitions.

#### Google Cloud PubSub

Pre-existing operators

`from_google_cloud_pubsub` and `to_google_cloud_pubsub` were already introduced to the old execution engine in previous Tenzir Node versions. Both work the same on the new engine.

##### Consume

Before:

```tql
load_google_cloud_pubsub project_id="acme", subscription_id="events"
read_json
```

After:

```tql
from_google_cloud_pubsub project_id="acme", subscription_id="events"
this = message.parse_json()
```

##### Produce

Before:

```tql
export
write_json
save_google_cloud_pubsub project_id="acme", topic_id="events"
```

After:

```tql
export
to_google_cloud_pubsub project_id="acme", topic_id="events", message=this.print_json()
```

`to_google_cloud_pubsub` requires an explicit `message=` expression. There is no default serialization format.

#### SQS

In compatibility mode, the legacy operators keep the names `load_sqs` and `save_sqs`. When you migrate SQS pipelines to the v6 new executor, use the vendor-qualified [`from_amazon_sqs`](/reference/operators/from_amazon_sqs.md) and [`to_amazon_sqs`](/reference/operators/to_amazon_sqs.md) operators.

##### Consume

Before:

```tql
load_sqs "queue"
read_json
```

After:

```tql
from_amazon_sqs "queue"
this = message.parse_json()
```

##### Produce

Before:

```tql
export
write_json
save_sqs "queue"
```

After:

```tql
export
to_amazon_sqs "queue"
```

`to_amazon_sqs` sends one SQS message per event and serializes it as NDJSON by default.

#### ZMQ

##### Consume

Before:

```tql
load_zmq "tcp://127.0.0.1:5555"
read_json
```

After:

```tql
from_zmq "tcp://127.0.0.1:5555" {
  read_json
}
```

##### Produce

Before:

```tql
export
write_json
save_zmq "tcp://127.0.0.1:5555"
```

After:

```tql
export
to_zmq "tcp://127.0.0.1:5555", encoding="json"
```

`to_zmq` requires an explicit `encoding=` argument. Use the same format names as the corresponding `write_*` operators, for example `"json"`, `"ndjson"`, or `"csv"`.

### Replace explicit stdio

Before:

```tql
load_stdin
read_ndjson
```

After:

```tql
from_stdin {
  read_ndjson
}
```

Before:

```tql
version
write_json
save_stdout
```

After:

```tql
version
to_stdout {
  write_json
}
```

### Capture packets from a network interface

Before:

```tql
load_nic "en0"
read_pcap
```

After:

```tql
from_nic "en0"
```

### Replace `from_http` response metadata fields

Before:

```tql
from_http "https://api.example.com/events", metadata_field=http_meta {
  read_json
}
where http_meta.code == 200
```

After:

```tql
from_http "https://api.example.com/events" {
  read_json
  where $response.code == 200
  http_meta = $response
}
```

### Replace `from_http` server mode

Before:

```tql
from_http "0.0.0.0:8080", server=true {
  read_json
}
import
```

After:

```tql
accept_http "0.0.0.0:8080" {
  read_json
}
import
```

### Replace per-event HTTP jobs

Before:

```tql
from {url: "https://api.example.com/a"},
     {url: "https://api.example.com/b"}
http url
```

After:

```tql
from {url: "https://api.example.com/a"},
     {url: "https://api.example.com/b"}
each parallel=4 {
  from_http $this.url {
    read_json
  }
}
```

### Remove explicit buffers

Before:

```tql
export live=true
buffer 100k, policy="drop"
write_ndjson
save_http "https://collector.example.com/events"
```

After:

```tql
export live=true
to_http "https://collector.example.com/events" {
  write_ndjson
}
```
