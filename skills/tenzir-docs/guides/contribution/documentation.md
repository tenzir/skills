# Documentation


The source code of the Tenzir documentation is at <https://github.com/tenzir/docs>. We use [Astro](https://astro.build) with [Starlight](https://starlight.astro.build) as our site framework.

## Local Development

### First-Time Setup

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tenzir/docs.git
   cd docs
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**:

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Start development server**:

   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

4. **View the site**: Browse to `http://localhost:4321/`

The development server includes:

* 🔥 Hot module reloading for instant updates
* 📝 Live Markdown rendering
* 🔍 Error reporting in the browser

### Production Build

Create and preview a production build:

```bash
# Build the site
bun run build


# Preview the build
bun run preview
```

Then browse to `http://localhost:4321/` to view the production site.

CI/CD Pipeline

Production builds are automatically created in CI. Check out our [GitHub workflow](https://github.com/tenzir/docs/blob/main/.github/workflows/docs.yaml) for implementation details.

## Link Checking

The documentation includes automated link validation to ensure all internal and external links work correctly:

### Local Link Checking

Before submitting changes, run link checking locally to catch broken links:

```bash
bun run build:linkcheck
```

This will build the site with link validation enabled and report any broken links found.

### CI Integration

Link checking runs automatically in our CI pipeline:

* **All builds**: Link validation is enabled for production builds
* **Pull requests**: Link checking runs as part of the lint workflow
* **Scheduled maintenance**: Weekly link checks run every Sunday to catch broken external links

### How It Works

The link checker validates:

* Internal page references (e.g., `/guides/quickstart`)
* Anchor links within pages (e.g., `/reference/operators#aggregate`)
* External URLs (with appropriate timeout and retry logic)
* Relative links between documentation files

### Fixing Broken Links

When the link checker finds issues:

1. **Invalid internal links**: Update the link to point to the correct page path
2. **Missing anchor references**: Ensure the target heading or element exists
3. **Broken external links**: Update URLs or remove outdated references
4. **False positives**: Add exclusions to the `starlightLinksValidator` configuration in `astro.config.mjs`

The link checker will cause builds to fail if broken links are detected, ensuring the documentation maintains high quality.

## Optimize Images

To keep the repository size manageable, always optimize image files *before* committing them. This is especially important for formats like PNG, which can contain unnecessary metadata or use inefficient compression.

### PNG Images

We recommend using [pngquant](https://pngquant.org/), a command-line utility for lossy compression of PNG files. It significantly reduces file size while preserving image quality.

To compress a PNG file in-place:

```bash
pngquant --ext .png --force --quality=65-80 image.png
```

### JPEG Images

Use [jpegoptim](https://github.com/tjko/jpegoptim), a utility for optimizing JPEGs without perceptible quality loss:

```bash
jpegoptim --strip-all --max=80 image.jpg
```

Alternatively, you can use [mozjpeg](https://github.com/mozilla/mozjpeg) for even better compression ratios.

### SVG Images

Use [svgo](https://github.com/svg/svgo), a Node-based tool to optimize SVG files by removing unnecessary data:

```bash
svgo image.svg
```

This automatically rewrites the file in-place with redundant code removed and optimized structure.

## Edit Diagrams

We use [Excalidraw](https://excalidraw.com) as primary tool to create sketches of architectural diagrams.

### Creating New Diagrams

For new diagrams, save the `.excalidraw` source file directly in the content directory alongside your markdown:

1. Create your diagram in Excalidraw (use light mode)
2. Save as `diagram-name.excalidraw` in the same directory as your markdown file
3. Reference it in markdown: `![Alt text](diagram-name.excalidraw)`
4. Run `bun run generate:excalidraw` to generate the SVG

The build process converts `.excalidraw` files to `.excalidraw.svg` and inlines them directly into the HTML. This enables automatic dark mode support via CSS.

Generated `.excalidraw.svg` files are gitignored—only the `.excalidraw` source files are tracked.

Don’t commit exported SVGs

Always commit `.excalidraw` source files, not exported SVGs. Source files are editable, diffable, and the build generates optimized SVGs automatically.

AI-assisted diagramming

Our [Excalidraw Claude plugin](https://github.com/tenzir/claude-plugins/tree/main/plugins/excalidraw) enables Claude to create and edit `.excalidraw` files directly. This is useful for generating diagrams from descriptions or making quick edits without leaving your editor.

### Editing Existing SVGs

Some older diagrams exist only as exported SVGs. When exporting Excalidraw scenes manually, always **use light mode** and **choose SVG** as export format, as we have CSS in place that automatically inverts colors so diagrams look nice in dark mode.

Tenzir developers have access to our Excalidraw [Documentation collection](https://app.excalidraw.com/o/6dBWEFf9h1l/9RErQkL9e2v). For everyone else, please reach out to us on our [Discord server](/discord) to request changes to existing SVGs.

## Writing Style and Formatting

This section covers the editorial and technical standards for contributing to the Tenzir documentation.

### Writing Guidelines

We follow the [Google Style Guide](https://developers.google.com/style) for clear and consistent technical documentation. Most notably:

* Use **active voice** in general.
* Avoid anthropomorphic language—don’t attribute human qualities to software or hardware.
* Include definite and indefinite articles (a, an, and the) in your writing. Don’t skip articles for brevity, including in headings and titles.
* In document titles and headings, use **sentence case**. Capitalize only the first word in the title, the first word in a subheading after a colon, and any proper nouns or other terms that are always capitalized a certain way.
* Capitalize product names.
* Write documentation in an **informal tone**—use common two-word contractions such as “you’re,” “don’t,” and “there’s.”
* **Define technical terms and acronyms** on first use. Don’t assume readers know specialized vocabulary.
* **Put the most important information first**. Don’t bury key details in the middle of paragraphs.
* **Use consistent terminology** throughout. Don’t use different words for the same concept (e.g., don’t alternate between “node” and “instance”).
* **Avoid unclear pronouns** like “it,” “this,” or “that” without clear antecedents. Be explicit about what you’re referring to.
* **Choose strong, specific verbs** over weak ones. Use “use” instead of “utilize,” “help” instead of “facilitate,” and “show” instead of “demonstrate.”
* **Eliminate redundant phrases**. Write “to” instead of “in order to,” “now” instead of “at this point in time,” and “because” instead of “due to the fact that.”
* **Avoid vague qualifiers** like “simply,” “just,” “easily,” or “obviously.” These don’t add clarity and may frustrate readers who find the task difficult.
* **Provide context** for why something matters. Don’t just explain what to do— explain when and why to do it.
* **Use hyperlinks judiciously**. Link to external tools, products, or resources when first mentioned, but avoid overlinking within the same document.

### Formatting Standards

Follow these conventions to maintain consistency across all documentation files.

#### General

* Every file must end with a newline character, but avoid empty lines at the end of a file.

#### Markdown Content

* Break lines at **80 characters**.
* When editing Markdown, run `bun run lint:markdown:fix` and `bun run lint:prettier:fix` when you’re done.

#### Code

* Avoid empty lines within functions.
* When editing source code (`.js`, `.jsx`, `.ts`, `.tsx`, `.astro` files), run `bun run lint:biome:fix` when you’re done.
