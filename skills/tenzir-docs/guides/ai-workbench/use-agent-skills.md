> Install Tenzir agent skills for documentation, schemas, and workflow automation


This guide shows you how to install and manage Tenzir’s agent skills. You’ll learn which skills are available, how to add skills globally or per project, install individual skills, and keep them up to date.

Tenzir publishes agent skills in the [`tenzir/skills`](https://github.com/tenzir/skills) repository.

Agent Skills

[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) is an open specification for packaging knowledge that AI agents can use. Skills provide structured documentation with progressive disclosure, letting agents load a condensed overview first and drill into details only when needed.

## Available skills

Tenzir publishes the following skills:

## Install skills

Tenzir skills are managed with the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI, which supports 40+ coding agents including Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, GitHub Copilot, and more.

### Install all skills

Install all Tenzir skills into the current project:

```bash
npx skills add tenzir/skills
```

The CLI auto-detects which coding agents you have installed and prompts you to select targets.

### Install individual skills

Append `@<skill-name>` to install a specific skill from the available skills:

```bash
npx skills add tenzir/skills@<skill-name>
```

### Use the ASIM skill

Install the Microsoft Sentinel ASIM schema skill when you want an agent to help choose ASIM schemas, map events or entities, inspect normalized fields, or resolve aliases:

```bash
npx skills add tenzir/skills@tenzir-asim
```

The `tenzir-asim` skill is generated from Microsoft Defender Docs and is optimized for schema-first mapping. Ask the agent to choose the ASIM schema before it maps fields, then use canonical ASIM field names such as `EventSchema`, `EventSchemaVersion`, `SrcIpAddr`, and `DstIpAddr`.

Tell the agent which context you want:

```text
Use the tenzir-asim skill to map this firewall event to a Microsoft
Sentinel ASIM NetworkSession record.
```

```text
Use the tenzir-asim skill to explain the required and recommended
fields for ASIM DNS events.
```

### Use the CEF skill

Install the ArcSight CEF skill when you want an agent to generate, parse, or map events in the Common Event Format, build ArcSight SmartConnector integrations, or look up predefined CEF extension keys and the ESM event schema behind them:

```bash
npx skills add tenzir/skills@tenzir-cef
```

The `tenzir-cef` skill is generated from the official OpenText CEF Implementation Standard and the ArcSight ESM Console User’s Guide. It documents the CEF header and escaping rules, all 174 predefined extension keys with types, lengths, and producer/consumer audience, the 479 ESM data fields across 18 schema groups, and the accepted date formats.

Tell the agent which context you want:

```text
Use the tenzir-cef skill to render these events as CEF messages, using
predefined extension keys where possible.
```

```text
Use the tenzir-cef skill to look up which ArcSight ESM field backs each
CEF extension key in this event.
```

### Use the CIM skill

Install the Splunk CIM schema skill when you want an agent to choose CIM data models, inspect datasets, apply tags, normalize fields, or use CIM lookup values:

```bash
npx skills add tenzir/skills@tenzir-cim
```

The `tenzir-cim` skill is generated from Splunk CIM 8.5. Ask the agent to choose the data model and dataset before it maps fields, then apply the tags, constraints, and recommended fields documented for that dataset.

Tell the agent which context you want:

```text
Use the tenzir-cim skill to map this firewall event to Splunk CIM Network
Traffic / All_Traffic fields.
```

```text
Use the tenzir-cim skill to explain the tags and recommended fields for CIM DNS
events.
```

### Use the ECS skill

Install the Elastic Common Schema skill when you want an agent to map events to ECS fields, choose categorization values, design custom fields, or align data with OpenTelemetry:

```bash
npx skills add tenzir/skills@tenzir-ecs
```

The `tenzir-ecs` skill is generated from the latest supported ECS release in the Tenzir skills repository. Ask the agent to choose `event.kind`, `event.category`, and `event.type` values before it maps fieldsets such as `source`, `destination`, `network`, `host`, `user`, or `observer`.

Tell the agent which context you want:

```text
Use the tenzir-ecs skill to map this firewall event to ECS. Use nested TQL
records that serialize to ECS field paths.
```

```text
Use the tenzir-ecs skill to choose event.category and event.type values for
this authentication event.
```

### Use the EDM skill

Install the FortiSIEM Event Data Model skill when you want an agent to choose FortiSIEM data models, inspect event attributes, or map events into FortiSIEM event attributes for built-in or custom parsers:

```bash
npx skills add tenzir/skills@tenzir-edm
```

The `tenzir-edm` skill is generated from the FortiSIEM 7.5.0 Event Data Model documentation. Ask the agent to choose the data model before it maps attributes, then populate the base event attributes first and use camelCase attribute names such as `eventType`, `srcIpAddr`, and `destIpAddr`.

Tell the agent which context you want:

```text
Use the tenzir-edm skill to map this firewall event to FortiSIEM network
traffic event attributes.
```

```text
Use the tenzir-edm skill to explain which attributes every FortiSIEM event
carries.
```

### Use the LEEF skill

Install the IBM QRadar LEEF skill when you want an agent to generate, parse, or map events in the Log Event Extended Format, build QRadar or JSA integrations, or look up predefined LEEF event attributes:

```bash
npx skills add tenzir/skills@tenzir-leef
```

The `tenzir-leef` skill is generated from the official IBM LEEF Version 2 format guide. It documents the LEEF 1.0 and 2.0 headers, delimiter rules, all 45 predefined event attributes with types and limits, custom event key guidelines, and `devTime`/`devTimeFormat` timestamp patterns.

Tell the agent which context you want:

```text
Use the tenzir-leef skill to render these events as LEEF 2.0 messages for
QRadar, using predefined attribute keys where possible.
```

```text
Use the tenzir-leef skill to explain the LEEF 2.0 header fields and how to
specify a custom attribute delimiter.
```

### Use the OCSF skill

Install the OCSF schema skill when you want an agent to choose OCSF event classes, inspect attributes, use profiles, or map source events into OCSF:

```bash
npx skills add tenzir/skills@tenzir-ocsf
```

The `tenzir-ocsf` skill tracks OCSF versions and schema reference files. Ask the agent to choose the OCSF version, event class, and profiles before it maps attributes.

Tell the agent which context you want:

```text
Use the tenzir-ocsf skill to map this Zeek connection event to an OCSF Network
Activity event.
```

```text
Use the tenzir-ocsf skill to explain which attributes are required for OCSF DNS
Activity.
```

### Use the UDM skill

Install the Google SecOps UDM schema skill when you want an agent to help generate UDM API ingestion payloads or write detection logic:

```bash
npx skills add tenzir/skills@tenzir-udm
```

The `tenzir-udm` skill supports two primary workflows. Generated UDM field headings can show two forms, for example `event_type / eventType`:

* Use the right-side ingestion object form when the agent maps logs into UDM event or entity objects for Google SecOps UDM API ingestion, including TQL mapping output such as `metadata.eventType`.
* Use the left-side field path form when the agent writes YARA-L, Detect Engine, CBN, or other dotted paths, such as `$event.metadata.event_type`.

Tell the agent which context you want:

```text
Use the tenzir-udm skill to map this firewall event to a UDM event object. Use
ingestion object field names in the TQL output.
```

```text
Use the tenzir-udm skill to write YARA-L detection logic for a UDM network
connection event. Use field path names.
```

### Choose the installation scope

Skills support two installation scopes:

| Scope       | Flag        | Location            | Use case                                            |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project** | *(default)* | `./<agent>/skills/` | Committed with your project, shared with your team. |
| **Global**  | `-g`        | `~/<agent>/skills/` | Available across all projects on your machine.      |

Install globally so skills are available everywhere:

```bash
npx skills add -g tenzir/skills
```

Install a specific skill globally:

```bash
npx skills add -g tenzir/skills@tenzir-docs
```

### Target specific agents

To install skills for specific agents only, use the `-a` flag:

```bash
npx skills add tenzir/skills -a pi
npx skills add tenzir/skills -a claude-code -a cursor -a codex
```
