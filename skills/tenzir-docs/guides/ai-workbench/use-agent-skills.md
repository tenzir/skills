# Use agent skills

> Access Tenzir documentation as an Agent Skill for any compatible AI agent


This guide shows you how to install and manage Tenzir’s agent skills. You’ll learn how to add skills globally or per project, install individual skills, and keep them up to date.

Tenzir publishes agent skills in the [`tenzir/skills`](https://github.com/tenzir/skills) repository.

Agent Skills

[Agent Skills](https://agentskills.io) is an open specification for packaging knowledge that AI agents can use. Skills provide structured documentation with progressive disclosure, letting agents load a condensed overview first and drill into details only when needed.

## Install skills

Tenzir skills are managed with the [`skills`](https://github.com/vercel-labs/skills) CLI, which supports 40+ coding agents including Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, GitHub Copilot, and more.

### Install all skills

Install all Tenzir skills into the current project:

```bash
npx skills add tenzir/skills
```

The CLI auto-detects which coding agents you have installed and prompts you to select targets.

### Install individual skills

Append `@<skill-name>` to install a specific skill:

```bash
npx skills add tenzir/skills@ocsf
npx skills add tenzir/skills@tenzir-docs
```

### Choose the installation scope

Skills support two installation scopes:

| Scope       | Flag        | Location            | Use case                                            |
| ----------- | ----------- | ------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Project** | *(default)* | `./<agent>/skills/` | Committed with your project, shared with your team. |
| **Global**  | `-g`        | `~/<agent>/skills/` | Available across all projects on your machine.      |

Install globally so skills are available everywhere:

```bash
npx skills add -g tenzir/skills
```

Install a specific skill globally:

```bash
npx skills add -g tenzir/skills@ocsf
```

### Target specific agents

To install skills for specific agents only, use the `-a` flag:

```bash
npx skills add tenzir/skills -a pi
npx skills add tenzir/skills -a claude-code -a cursor -a codex
```

## Manage skills

### List installed skills

```bash
npx skills list
```

Filter by scope or agent:

```bash
npx skills list -g
npx skills list -a pi
```

### Check for updates

```bash
npx skills check
```

### Update skills

```bash
npx skills update
```

### Remove skills

Remove interactively:

```bash
npx skills remove
```

Remove a specific skill:

```bash
npx skills remove ocsf
```

Remove all installed Tenzir skills:

```bash
npx skills remove --all
```
