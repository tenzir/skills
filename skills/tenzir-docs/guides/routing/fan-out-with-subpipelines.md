# Fan out with subpipelines


This guide shows you how to fan out an event stream into subpipelines with [`each`](/reference/operators/each.md) and [`group`](/reference/operators/group.md). You’ll learn when to spawn one subpipeline per event, when to keep one subpipeline per key, and how these operators differ from fixed fan-out operators like [`fork`](/reference/operators/fork.md), [`parallel`](/reference/operators/parallel.md), and [`load_balance`](/reference/operators/load_balance.md).

## Choose a fan-out pattern

Tenzir has several operators that send events into subpipelines. Choose the operator based on how many subpipelines you need and how events should flow into them:

| Operator                                               | Subpipelines                          | Event flow                                                         | Use case                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------- |
| [`fork`](/reference/operators/fork.md)                 | One fixed side branch                 | Every event goes to the main pipeline and the side branch          | Archive or publish a copy while continuing processing         |
| [`parallel`](/reference/operators/parallel.md)         | A fixed number of workers             | Each event goes to one worker running the same subpipeline         | Speed up CPU-heavy or I/O-heavy work                          |
| [`load_balance`](/reference/operators/load_balance.md) | One branch per configured target      | Each event goes to one target                                      | Distribute load across equivalent sinks                       |
| [`each`](/reference/operators/each.md)                 | One fresh subpipeline per input event | The input event is available as `$this`; it is not passed as input | Run a per-event job, such as a lookup or export               |
| [`group`](/reference/operators/group.md)               | One subpipeline per key               | Matching events are passed to the same keyed subpipeline           | Keep per-tenant, per-host, or per-session processing isolated |

Use regular transformations when every event can flow through the same linear pipeline. Use subpipeline fan-out when the pipeline structure itself depends on each event or key.

## Run one subpipeline per event

Use [`each`](/reference/operators/each.md) when every input event describes a job to run. The nested pipeline must start with a source because `each` does not pass the input event into the subpipeline. Instead, it binds the current event record to `$this`.

The following pipeline treats incoming cases as lookup requests. Each case queries the same historical dataset for matching source IPs and annotates the matches with the case ID:

```tql
from {case_id: "C-1", ip: "10.0.0.5"},
     {case_id: "C-2", ip: "10.0.0.7"}
each parallel=4 {
  from {ts: 2024-01-01T10:00:00, src_ip: "10.0.0.5", action: "login"},
       {ts: 2024-01-01T10:02:00, src_ip: "10.0.0.8", action: "scan"},
       {ts: 2024-01-01T10:05:00, src_ip: "10.0.0.7", action: "download"}
  where src_ip == $this.ip
  case_id = $this.case_id
}
sort case_id, ts
```

```tql
{
  ts: 2024-01-01T10:00:00.000000,
  src_ip: "10.0.0.5",
  action: "login",
  case_id: "C-1",
}
{
  ts: 2024-01-01T10:05:00.000000,
  src_ip: "10.0.0.7",
  action: "download",
  case_id: "C-2",
}
```

The `parallel` option limits how many per-event jobs run at the same time. When more events arrive, `each` queues them and applies back pressure upstream until a running subpipeline finishes. Keep this value bounded for external APIs, expensive exports, or destinations with rate limits.

## Keep one subpipeline per key

Use [`group`](/reference/operators/group.md) when events with the same key must go through the same subpipeline. Unlike `each`, the nested pipeline receives input: Tenzir sends all matching events for a key to that key’s subpipeline. The key is available as `$group` inside the subpipeline.

The following pipeline keeps tenant streams separate and computes a summary per tenant:

```tql
from {tenant: "alpha", bytes: 120},
     {tenant: "beta", bytes: 90},
     {tenant: "alpha", bytes: 80}
group tenant {
  summarize events=count(), bytes=sum(bytes)
  tenant = $group
}
sort tenant
```

```tql
{
  events: 2,
  bytes: 200,
  tenant: "alpha",
}
{
  events: 1,
  bytes: 90,
  tenant: "beta",
}
```

For a pure aggregation, [`summarize`](/reference/operators/summarize.md) is usually shorter. Use `group` when the per-key subpipeline does more than aggregate, such as keeping state, applying a keyed transformation, or writing to a key-specific sink.

## Write separate outputs per key

A common `group` pattern is to write each tenant, host, or sensor to its own file. The subpipeline ends with a sink, so `group` itself becomes a sink:

```tql
from {tenant: "alpha", message: "login"},
     {tenant: "beta", message: "scan"},
     {tenant: "alpha", message: "logout"}
group tenant {
  to_file f"/tmp/tenzir/{$group}.json" {
    write_ndjson
  }
}
```

This creates one subpipeline per tenant and writes matching events to that subpipeline’s file.

## Avoid common mistakes

* Don’t use `each` for ordinary per-event transformations. Use regular TQL statements or [`parallel`](/reference/operators/parallel.md) when every event follows the same processing steps.
* Don’t use `group` only to calculate grouped totals. Use [`summarize`](/reference/operators/summarize.md) unless you need a full subpipeline per key.
* Don’t leave `each` unbounded for external systems. Set `parallel` to match the concurrency that the downstream service can handle.
* Remember that `each` subpipelines must start with a source, while `group` subpipelines receive the grouped input stream.
* Neither `each` nor `group` can use subpipelines that produce bytes as output.
