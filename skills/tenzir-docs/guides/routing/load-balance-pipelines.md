# Load-balance pipelines


This guide shows you how to distribute events across multiple destinations using the [`load_balance`](/reference/operators/load_balance.md) operator. You’ll learn to route events to multiple endpoints for high availability and throughput.

## How load balancing works

The `load_balance` operator spawns a nested pipeline for each element in a configuration list. Incoming events are distributed to exactly one of the nested pipelines, enabling you to spread load across multiple destinations.

```tql
let $endpoints = ["host1:8080", "host2:8080", "host3:8080"]
subscribe "events"
load_balance $endpoints {
  write_json
  save_tcp $endpoints
}
```

Each event goes to exactly one endpoint. The operator may reorder the event stream to optimize throughput.

## Basic patterns

### Multiple TCP endpoints

Distribute events across multiple TCP receivers:

```tql
let $cfg = ["192.168.0.30:8080", "192.168.0.31:8080"]


subscribe "input"
load_balance $cfg {
  write_json
  save_tcp $cfg
}
```

### Multiple Kafka brokers

Balance writes across Kafka clusters:

```tql
let $brokers = [
  {host: "kafka1.example.com", topic: "events"},
  {host: "kafka2.example.com", topic: "events"},
]


subscribe "events"
load_balance $brokers {
  to_kafka $brokers.topic, options={"bootstrap.servers": $brokers.host}
}
```

## Complex configurations

### Splunk with different credentials

Route to multiple Splunk instances, each with its own authentication:

```tql
let $cfg = [
  {ip: "192.168.0.30", token: "token-1234"},
  {ip: "192.168.0.31", token: "token-5678"},
]


subscribe "input"
load_balance $cfg {
  let $endpoint = string($cfg.ip) + ":8088"
  to_splunk $endpoint, hec_token=$cfg.token
}
```

### OpenSearch with index routing

Balance across OpenSearch clusters with per-cluster configuration:

```tql
let $clusters = [
  {url: "https://es1.example.com:9200", index: "logs-primary"},
  {url: "https://es2.example.com:9200", index: "logs-secondary"},
]


subscribe "logs"
load_balance $clusters {
  to_opensearch $clusters.url, action="index", index=$clusters.index
}
```

## When to use load\_balance

Use `load_balance` when you need to:

* **Scale throughput**: Distribute events across multiple receivers
* **Achieve high availability**: Route to backup endpoints when primary is busy
* **Handle heterogeneous destinations**: Route to endpoints with different credentials or configurations

### Comparison with other operators

| Operator                                               | Behavior                        | Use case                       |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| [`load_balance`](/reference/operators/load_balance.md) | Events go to exactly one target | Throughput scaling, HA         |
| [`fork`](/reference/operators/fork.md)                 | Events copied to all targets    | Parallel processing, archiving |
| [`publish`](/reference/operators/publish.md)           | Events go to all subscribers    | Fan-out to pipelines           |

## Requirements

The nested pipeline inside `load_balance` must end with a sink operator. The configuration variable must be declared with `let` before use.
