# Map to ECS


This guide shows you how to map events to Elastic Common Schema (ECS) in TQL. You’ll learn how to populate required ECS fields, choose event categorization values, map common network fieldsets, preserve source-specific details, and prepare records for Elasticsearch-compatible destinations.

The TQL examples in this guide use nested records that serialize to ECS field paths. For example, `source.ip` in ECS becomes `source: {ip: ...}` in TQL.

## Use the ECS skill

Install the `tenzir-ecs` skill when you want an agent to help with ECS schema decisions. See [Use agent skills](../ai-workbench/use-agent-skills.md#use-the-ecs-skill) for installation and usage examples.

Ask the agent to choose `event.kind`, `event.category`, and `event.type` values before it maps fieldsets. ECS treats `event.category` and `event.type` as lists, and values such as `allowed` or `denied` belong in `event.type` or `event.action`, not automatically in `event.outcome`.

## Choose ECS categorization

Start by setting the fields that define the document contract and search behavior:

* `@timestamp`: The time when the event originated.
* `ecs.version`: The ECS version used for the mapping.
* `event.kind`: The high-level kind, such as `event`, `alert`, `metric`, or `pipeline_error`.
* `event.category`: The broad category list, such as `network`.
* `event.type`: The subtype list, such as `connection`, `allowed`, or `denied`.

For a firewall connection event, choose `event.kind: event`, `event.category: [network]`, and an `event.type` list that includes `connection` plus the normalized disposition when the source records one.

## Write a small mapping

The following example shows a package mapper that maps a parsed firewall connection event to ECS. It keeps all mapping work inside the `event` argument, puts the source data under `fw`, sets ECS categorization fields, maps network participants, normalizes the transport protocol, and preserves unmapped residue under a custom namespace.

```tql
---
args:
  named:
    - name: event
      description: The field that holds the event to map.
      type: field
      default: this
---


$event = {...$event, fw: $event, ecs: {}}


let $event_types = {
  allow: ["connection", "allowed"],
  allowed: ["connection", "allowed"],
  block: ["connection", "denied"],
  blocked: ["connection", "denied"],
  deny: ["connection", "denied"],
  denied: ["connection", "denied"],
  drop: ["connection", "denied"],
  dropped: ["connection", "denied"],
}


$event.ecs["@timestamp"] = move $event.fw.ts
$event.ecs.ecs.version = "9.4.0"
$event.ecs.event.kind = "event"
$event.ecs.event.category = ["network"]
$event.ecs.event.type = $event_types[$event.fw.action.to_lower()]? else ["connection"]
$event.ecs.event.action = (move $event.fw.action).to_lower()
$event.ecs.source.ip = move $event.fw.src_ip
$event.ecs.source.port = move $event.fw.src_port
$event.ecs.source.bytes = move $event.fw.bytes_out
$event.ecs.destination.ip = move $event.fw.dst_ip
$event.ecs.destination.port = move $event.fw.dst_port
$event.ecs.destination.bytes = move $event.fw.bytes_in
$event.ecs.network.transport = (move $event.fw.proto).to_lower()
$event.ecs.network.bytes = $event.ecs.source.bytes + $event.ecs.destination.bytes
$event.ecs.observer.hostname = move $event.fw.device
$event.ecs.observer.vendor = "Example Networks"
$event.ecs.observer.product = "Example Firewall"


$event = {...$event.ecs, example: {unmapped: $event.fw}}
```

A call with a firewall event such as `{ts: 2024-01-15T10:30:45Z, action: "allowed", src_ip: "10.0.0.5", src_port: 51544, dst_ip: "203.0.113.10", dst_port: 443, proto: "tcp", bytes_out: 1280, bytes_in: 8192, device: "edge-fw-01"}` produces an ECS event like this:

```tql
{
  "@timestamp": 2024-01-15T10:30:45Z,
  ecs: {
    version: "9.4.0",
  },
  event: {
    kind: "event",
    category: [
      "network",
    ],
    type: [
      "connection",
      "allowed",
    ],
    action: "allowed",
  },
  source: {
    ip: "10.0.0.5",
    port: 51544,
    bytes: 1280,
  },
  destination: {
    ip: "203.0.113.10",
    port: 443,
    bytes: 8192,
  },
  network: {
    transport: "tcp",
    bytes: 9472,
  },
  observer: {
    hostname: "edge-fw-01",
    vendor: "Example Networks",
    product: "Example Firewall",
  },
  example: {
    unmapped: {},
  },
}
```

## Apply the mapping pattern

Use the same structure for larger mappings:

* **Use the event scope**: Package mappers accept a named `event` field argument with `default: this`, create source and target namespaces with an initial spread, and mutate only fields below `$event`.
* **Keep a source namespace**: Keep the parsed event under a short namespace such as `fw`, `dns`, `edr`, or `event` before you create ECS fields.
* **Populate required fields first**: Set `@timestamp` and `ecs.version` before you map event-specific fieldsets.
* **Choose categorization before fields**: Let `event.kind`, `event.category`, and `event.type` drive which fieldsets you populate.
* **Use role-specific fieldsets**: Use `source` and `destination` for packet or flow direction, and use `client` and `server` when the protocol role matters.
* **Normalize categorical values explicitly**: Map source strings to ECS categorization values such as `network`, `connection`, `allowed`, or `denied`.
* **Preserve custom data deliberately**: Put source-specific details that don’t have an ECS target into a custom namespace, not into a field that ECS already defines for another purpose.

## Send ECS to Elastic-compatible destinations

After you map events to ECS, send them to Elasticsearch or OpenSearch with the Bulk API operators:

```tql
my_source::ecs::map
to_elasticsearch "https://elasticsearch.example.com:9200",
  action="index",
  index="ecs-events"
```

If the parsed source event lives in a nested field, pass that field explicitly and promote the mapped ECS document before indexing:

```tql
my_source::ecs::map event=parsed
this = parsed
to_elasticsearch "https://elasticsearch.example.com:9200",
  action="index",
  index="ecs-events"
```

Use [`to_opensearch`](/reference/operators/to_opensearch.md) instead when the destination is OpenSearch.
