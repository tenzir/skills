# Aggregate event streams


This guide shows you how to aggregate event streams with [`summarize`](/reference/operators/summarize.md) and [`window`](/reference/operators/window.md). You’ll learn to count, group, compute statistics, and build bounded event-time detections over streaming data.

## Understanding the summarize operator

The [`summarize`](/reference/operators/summarize.md) operator groups events and applies aggregation functions. Its syntax is:

```plaintext
summarize <aggregation>, <aggregation>, ..., <group>, <group>, ...
```

Where:

* Aggregations are expressions like [`sum`](/reference/functions/sum.md), [`count`](/reference/functions/count.md), [`mean`](/reference/functions/mean.md), etc.
* Groups are field names to group by

## Basic aggregations

Start with fundamental aggregation functions on event streams.

### Count events

Count total events and unique values with [`count`](/reference/functions/count.md) and [`count_distinct`](/reference/functions/count_distinct.md):

```tql
from {product: "apple", price: 100, category: "fruit"},
     {product: "banana", price: 250, category: "fruit"},
     {product: "carrot", price: 175, category: "vegetable"},
     {product: "apple", price: 120, category: "fruit"},
     {product: "banana", price: 225, category: "fruit"}
summarize total_count = count(), unique_products = count_distinct(product)
```

```tql
{
  total_count: 5,
  unique_products: 3
}
```

### Sum and average

Calculate totals and averages:

```tql
from {product: "apple", price: 100, quantity: 2},
     {product: "banana", price: 250, quantity: 1},
     {product: "carrot", price: 175, quantity: 3},
     {product: "apple", price: 120, quantity: 2},
     {product: "banana", price: 225, quantity: 1}
summarize total_revenue = sum(price * quantity), avg_price = mean(price), total_quantity = sum(quantity)
```

```tql
{
  total_revenue: 1440,
  avg_price: 174.0,
  total_quantity: 9
}
```

### Min and max

Find extreme values with [`min`](/reference/functions/min.md) and [`max`](/reference/functions/max.md):

```tql
from {sensor: "A", temperature: 72, timestamp: 2024-01-15T10:00:00},
     {sensor: "B", temperature: 68, timestamp: 2024-01-15T10:05:00},
     {sensor: "A", temperature: 75, timestamp: 2024-01-15T10:10:00},
     {sensor: "B", temperature: 82, timestamp: 2024-01-15T10:15:00},
     {sensor: "A", temperature: 71, timestamp: 2024-01-15T10:20:00}
summarize min_temp = min(temperature), max_temp = max(temperature), earliest = min(timestamp), latest = max(timestamp)
```

```tql
{
  min_temp: 68,
  max_temp: 82,
  earliest: 2024-01-15T10:00:00.000000,
  latest: 2024-01-15T10:20:00.000000
}
```

## Grouping data

Group events by one or more fields to calculate aggregations per group.

### Group by single field

Calculate statistics per category:

```tql
from {product: "apple", price: 100, category: "fruit"},
     {product: "banana", price: 250, category: "fruit"},
     {product: "carrot", price: 175, category: "vegetable"},
     {product: "lettuce", price: 125, category: "vegetable"},
     {product: "orange", price: 225, category: "fruit"}
summarize avg_price = mean(price), item_count = count(), category
```

```tql
{
  avg_price: 191.66666666666666,
  item_count: 3,
  category: "fruit",
}
{
  avg_price: 150.0,
  item_count: 2,
  category: "vegetable",
}
```

### Group by multiple fields

Group by multiple dimensions:

```tql
from {user: "alice", action: "login", duration: 45, date: "2024-01-15"},
     {user: "bob", action: "login", duration: 38, date: "2024-01-15"},
     {user: "alice", action: "view", duration: 12, date: "2024-01-15"},
     {user: "alice", action: "login", duration: 52, date: "2024-01-16"},
     {user: "bob", action: "edit", duration: 89, date: "2024-01-16"}
summarize avg_duration = mean(duration), action_count = count(), user, action
```

```tql
{
  avg_duration: 38.0,
  action_count: 1,
  user: "bob",
  action: "login",
}
{
  avg_duration: 89.0,
  action_count: 1,
  user: "bob",
  action: "edit",
}
{
  avg_duration: 48.5,
  action_count: 2,
  user: "alice",
  action: "login",
}
{
  avg_duration: 12.0,
  action_count: 1,
  user: "alice",
  action: "view",
}
```

## Aggregate periodic snapshots

Use [`every`](/reference/operators/every.md) when the aggregation is tied to a wall-clock schedule, such as polling an inventory API every 10 minutes and publishing a current count of endpoint states. This pattern works well for dashboards, reports, cache refreshes, and external API polling where each run describes the current snapshot.

Don’t use [`every`](/reference/operators/every.md) for streaming detections where delayed or out-of-order events can change the answer. Use [`window`](/reference/operators/window.md) for event-time detections.

```tql
every 10min {
  from {host: "laptop-1", status: "healthy"},
       {host: "server-1", status: "healthy"},
       {host: "laptop-2", status: "stale"}
  summarize status, endpoint_count=count()
  snapshot_time = now()
}
head 2
sort status
```

Each run fetches a fresh snapshot, groups endpoints by current status, and adds the run time. The `from` block stands in for an inventory API response; in a long-running pipeline, replace it with [`from_http`](/reference/operators/from_http.md), remove [`head`](/reference/operators/head.md), and publish the compact summary to a channel or destination.

The wall-clock schedule is not an event-time window. If the pipeline starts at 09:00, [`every`](/reference/operators/every.md) runs the subpipeline for `[09:00, 09:10)`, then restarts it for `[09:10, 09:20)`, and so on. The boundaries depend on when the pipeline starts, not on timestamps in the fetched data.

## Window event streams

Use [`window`](/reference/operators/window.md) when you need bounded event-time aggregations on a stream. The operator creates one subpipeline per fixed time range. Inside that subpipeline, use [`summarize`](/reference/operators/summarize.md) to compute counts, distinct values, and statistics for the events in that window.

Unlike [`summarize`](/reference/operators/summarize.md) with `options={frequency: ...}`, [`window`](/reference/operators/window.md) assigns events by event time. This lets you tolerate out-of-order data with `tolerance` and group entities inside each event-time window. Put [`group`](/reference/operators/group.md) outside [`window`](/reference/operators/window.md) only when each key needs its own event-time clock.

### Detect brute-force login attempts

The following streaming detection uses OCSF Authentication events. It groups failed logons by user and source IP address, counts failures in 10-minute event-time windows, and emits an alert when a pair exceeds the threshold. The sample records show only the OCSF fields used by the detection:

```tql
from {time: 2024-01-01T10:00:00, activity_id: 1, status_id: 2, user: {name: "alice"}, src_endpoint: {ip: 10.0.0.5}, dst_endpoint: {hostname: "vpn-1"}},
     {time: 2024-01-01T10:01:00, activity_id: 1, status_id: 2, user: {name: "alice"}, src_endpoint: {ip: 10.0.0.5}, dst_endpoint: {hostname: "vpn-2"}},
     {time: 2024-01-01T10:02:00, activity_id: 1, status_id: 2, user: {name: "alice"}, src_endpoint: {ip: 10.0.0.5}, dst_endpoint: {hostname: "vpn-1"}},
     {time: 2024-01-01T10:03:00, activity_id: 1, status_id: 2, user: {name: "alice"}, src_endpoint: {ip: 10.0.0.5}, dst_endpoint: {hostname: "vpn-2"}},
     {time: 2024-01-01T10:04:00, activity_id: 1, status_id: 2, user: {name: "alice"}, src_endpoint: {ip: 10.0.0.5}, dst_endpoint: {hostname: "vpn-3"}},
     {time: 2024-01-01T10:05:00, activity_id: 1, status_id: 2, user: {name: "alice"}, src_endpoint: {ip: 10.0.0.5}, dst_endpoint: {hostname: "vpn-3"}},
     {time: 2024-01-01T10:06:00, activity_id: 1, status_id: 2, user: {name: "bob"}, src_endpoint: {ip: 10.0.0.8}, dst_endpoint: {hostname: "vpn-1"}}
where activity_id == 1 and status_id == 2
window size=10min, on=time, tolerance=30s, idle_timeout=5min {
  group {user: user.name, src_ip: src_endpoint.ip} {
    summarize failures=count(), target_hosts=count_distinct(dst_endpoint.hostname)
    user = $group.user
    src_ip = $group.src_ip
    start = $window.start
    end = $window.end
  }
}
where failures >= 5
select user, src_ip, failures, target_hosts, start, end
```

```tql
{
  user: "alice",
  src_ip: 10.0.0.5,
  failures: 6,
  target_hosts: 3,
  start: 2024-01-01T10:00:00Z,
  end: 2024-01-01T10:10:00Z,
}
```

In OCSF Authentication events, `activity_id: 1` means logon and `status_id: 2` means failure. The outer [`group`](/reference/operators/group.md) gives every user and source IP pair its own event-time clock. The `idle_timeout` closes sparse keys after wall-clock inactivity so live detections don’t wait indefinitely for the next event from the same key.

This example uses tumbling windows because [`window`](/reference/operators/window.md) omits `every`. With `size=10min`, the intervals are `[10:00, 10:10)`, `[10:10, 10:20)`, and so on for each grouped user and source IP pair. An event exactly at `10:10` belongs to the second window because window ends are exclusive.

### Detect SMB traffic spikes

You can combine [`window`](/reference/operators/window.md) with statistical aggregations to detect SMB traffic spikes. The next example is a lightweight TQL adaptation of Splunk’s [SMB Traffic Spike](https://github.com/splunk/security_content/blob/4493a82b24dc7e93a612c229e842751c853b96c8/detections/network/smb_traffic_spike.yml) analytic. It starts with pre-aggregated OCSF SMB Activity buckets to keep the detection readable and interleaves the sources by timestamp to match event-time order. The sample records show only the OCSF fields used by the detection.

```tql
from {time: 2024-01-01T00:00:00, src_endpoint: {hostname: "workstation-7"}, traffic: {bytes: 10}},
     {time: 2024-01-01T00:00:00, src_endpoint: {hostname: "file-server-1"}, traffic: {bytes: 120}},
     {time: 2024-01-01T00:10:00, src_endpoint: {hostname: "workstation-7"}, traffic: {bytes: 11}},
     {time: 2024-01-01T00:10:00, src_endpoint: {hostname: "file-server-1"}, traffic: {bytes: 118}},
     {time: 2024-01-01T00:20:00, src_endpoint: {hostname: "workstation-7"}, traffic: {bytes: 9}},
     {time: 2024-01-01T00:20:00, src_endpoint: {hostname: "file-server-1"}, traffic: {bytes: 121}},
     {time: 2024-01-01T00:30:00, src_endpoint: {hostname: "workstation-7"}, traffic: {bytes: 10}},
     {time: 2024-01-01T00:30:00, src_endpoint: {hostname: "file-server-1"}, traffic: {bytes: 119}},
     {time: 2024-01-01T00:40:00, src_endpoint: {hostname: "workstation-7"}, traffic: {bytes: 10}},
     {time: 2024-01-01T00:40:00, src_endpoint: {hostname: "file-server-1"}, traffic: {bytes: 122}},
     {time: 2024-01-01T00:50:00, src_endpoint: {hostname: "workstation-7"}, traffic: {bytes: 10}},
     {time: 2024-01-01T00:50:00, src_endpoint: {hostname: "file-server-1"}, traffic: {bytes: 120}},
     {time: 2024-01-01T01:00:00, src_endpoint: {hostname: "workstation-7"}, traffic: {bytes: 80}},
     {time: 2024-01-01T01:00:00, src_endpoint: {hostname: "file-server-1"}, traffic: {bytes: 123}}
window size=70min, every=10min, on=time {
  summarize src=src_endpoint.hostname,
            samples=count(),
            avg_bytes=mean(traffic.bytes),
            stdev_bytes=stddev(traffic.bytes),
            current_bytes=max(traffic.bytes)
  upper_bound = avg_bytes + stdev_bytes * 2
  where samples >= 5 and current_bytes > upper_bound
  start = $window.start
  end = $window.end
}
select src, current_bytes, upper_bound, start, end
sort start
```

```tql
{
  src: "workstation-7",
  current_bytes: 80,
  upper_bound: 69.00145770426485,
  start: 2024-01-01T00:00:00Z,
  end: 2024-01-01T01:10:00Z,
}
{
  src: "workstation-7",
  current_bytes: 80,
  upper_bound: 73.85436210874914,
  start: 2024-01-01T00:10:00Z,
  end: 2024-01-01T01:20:00Z,
}
```

The `workstation-7` bucket with `80` bytes exceeds the mean plus two standard deviations in two 70-minute windows, while the steady file-server traffic stays below its bound. The simplified detector uses the maximum bucket in each window as the candidate spike.

This example uses a hopping window: `size=70min` defines the lookback and `every=10min` moves the window forward every 10 minutes. Around midnight, Tenzir evaluates intervals such as `[00:00, 01:10)`, `[00:10, 01:20)`, and `[00:20, 01:30)`. A 10-minute traffic bucket can participate in multiple open windows, which gives rolling context but can also produce repeated alerts for the same spike unless you add downstream suppression.

Pre-aggregate raw OCSF SMB events

If your input stream contains one OCSF SMB Activity event per file operation, pre-aggregate it into 10-minute bucket events before running the spike detector:

```tql
from {class_uid: 4006, time: 2024-01-01T00:00:00, src_endpoint: {hostname: "workstation-7"}, traffic: {bytes: 4}},
     {class_uid: 4006, time: 2024-01-01T00:03:00, src_endpoint: {hostname: "workstation-7"}, traffic: {bytes: 6}},
     {class_uid: 4006, time: 2024-01-01T00:10:00, src_endpoint: {hostname: "workstation-7"}, traffic: {bytes: 11}}
where class_uid == 4006
window size=10min, on=time, tolerance=2min {
  summarize src=src_endpoint.hostname, smb_bytes=sum(traffic.bytes)
  time = $window.start
  src_endpoint = {hostname: src}
  traffic = {bytes: smb_bytes}
}
select time, src_endpoint, traffic
```

```tql
{time: 2024-01-01T00:00:00Z, src_endpoint: {hostname: "workstation-7"}, traffic: {bytes: 10}}
{time: 2024-01-01T00:10:00Z, src_endpoint: {hostname: "workstation-7"}, traffic: {bytes: 11}}
```

This keeps the detector focused on the rolling statistical comparison while the pre-aggregation step handles the raw event volume.

### Compare TQL with KQL, SPL, and Cribl Stream

The following sections compare aggregation and windowing capabilities across TQL, Microsoft KQL, Splunk SPL, and Cribl Stream. They cover Tenzir’s [`summarize`](/reference/operators/summarize.md), [`every`](/reference/operators/every.md), [`group`](/reference/operators/group.md), and [`window`](/reference/operators/window.md) operators. Cribl Stream entries refer to pipeline Functions, especially [Aggregations](https://docs.cribl.io/stream/aggregations-function/), not Cribl Search.

#### Complete-input aggregation

Complete-input aggregation waits for the full input and then emits final aggregate results. Use it for batch summaries where intermediate updates and event-time boundaries do not matter.

#### Periodic running stats

Periodic running stats emit accumulated values repeatedly instead of waiting for the stream to end. They show the total so far, not a bounded rolling lookback.

#### Wall-clock subpipeline batches

Wall-clock subpipeline batches rerun a block of work on a fixed schedule. This is useful when the work fetches or refreshes data, rather than grouping existing events by event time.

#### Tumbling event-time windows

Tumbling event-time windows split events into adjacent, non-overlapping time ranges based on event timestamps. Each event belongs to one window, and each window produces its own result.

| SPL          | ✅       | Use `timechart span=1h` or `bin _time`.                          |
| Cribl Stream | ✅       | Use Aggregations `Time window`.                                  |

#### Hopping event-time windows

Hopping event-time windows use a window size that is larger than the step between window starts. This gives rolling context with repeated overlapping windows, so one event can contribute to several results.

| System       | Support | Notes                                                                      |
| ------------ | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TQL          | ✅       | Use [`window`](/reference/operators/window.md) `size=1h, every=5m, on=ts`. |
| KQL          | ⚠️      | Use manual expansion or plugins for specific metrics.                      |
| SPL          | ⚠️      | Use `streamstats` workarounds or manual bucketing.                         |
| Cribl Stream | ❌       | No hopping window option.                                                  |

#### Per-input-event rolling stats

Per-input-event rolling stats update a trailing calculation for each arriving event. This is different from periodic emission because the output cadence follows events, not a timer.

| System       | Support | Notes                                                                                 |
| ------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TQL          | ❌       | Not native; [`summarize`](/reference/operators/summarize.md) `frequency` is periodic. |
| KQL          | ⚠️      | Use manual expansion or row-window functions.                                         |
| SPL          | ✅       | Use `streamstats time_window=...`.                                                    |
| Cribl Stream | ❌       | Aggregations emit window events.                                                      |

#### Per-key event-time windows

Per-key event-time windows keep separate windowed results for each entity. Events from one noisy key cannot advance or close windows for another key.

| System       | Support | Notes                                                                                             |
| ------------ | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TQL          | ✅       | Compose [`group`](/reference/operators/group.md) with [`window`](/reference/operators/window.md). |
| KQL          | ✅       | Use `summarize ... by key, bin(ts, ...)`.                                                         |
| SPL          | ✅       | Use `BY key` or split-by.                                                                         |
| Cribl Stream | ✅       | Use `Group by fields` with `Time window`.                                                         |

#### Streaming late-event tolerance

Streaming late-event tolerance controls how long a window remains open for out-of-order events. It lets a pipeline accept delayed data without holding every window until the input ends.

| System       | Support | Notes                                                           |
| ------------ | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TQL          | ✅       | Use [`window`](/reference/operators/window.md) `tolerance=...`. |
| KQL          | ❌       | Mostly batch or query-time semantics.                           |
| SPL          | ⚠️      | Depends on search order.                                        |
| Cribl Stream | ✅       | Use Aggregations `Lag tolerance`.                               |

#### Independent per-key event-time clocks

Independent per-key clocks let each group advance event time based only on its own events. This prevents a busy key from making sparse keys late, but sparse windows may also close later.

| System       | Support | Notes                                                                                                    |
| ------------ | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TQL          | ✅       | Put [`window`](/reference/operators/window.md) inside an outer [`group`](/reference/operators/group.md). |
| KQL          | ❌       | No streaming clock per key in ad hoc KQL.                                                                |
| SPL          | ⚠️      | Requires search-order dependent workarounds.                                                             |
| Cribl Stream | ⚠️      | Grouped buckets exist, but no documented per-key clock.                                                  |

#### Arbitrary subpipeline per key

An arbitrary per-key subpipeline can do more than compute a fixed aggregate list. It can reshape, filter, enrich, or sink each group’s stream independently.

| System       | Support | Notes                                                       |
| ------------ | ------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| TQL          | ✅       | Use [`group`](/reference/operators/group.md) `key { ... }`. |
| KQL          | ❌       | No direct equivalent.                                       |
| SPL          | ❌       | No direct equivalent.                                       |
| Cribl Stream | ❌       | No grouped Function block.                                  |

#### Arbitrary subpipeline per window

An arbitrary per-window subpipeline runs custom logic inside each event-time range. It covers detections that need more than a fixed aggregate list, such as post-aggregation filtering or alert formatting.

| System       | Support | Notes                                                     |
| ------------ | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| TQL          | ✅       | Use [`window`](/reference/operators/window.md) `{ ... }`. |
| KQL          | ❌       | No direct equivalent.                                     |
| SPL          | ❌       | No direct equivalent.                                     |
| Cribl Stream | ❌       | Aggregations only emit configured outputs.                |

#### Sink per key or per window

A sink per key or window sends results from inside the grouped or windowed scope. This supports local alerting or routing decisions without merging all results back into a shared stream first.

| System       | Support | Notes                                                                                                            |
| ------------ | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TQL          | ✅       | [`group`](/reference/operators/group.md) and [`window`](/reference/operators/window.md) blocks can end in sinks. |
| KQL          | ❌       | No direct query-language equivalent.                                                                             |
| SPL          | ❌       | No direct query-language equivalent.                                                                             |
| Cribl Stream | ⚠️      | Route emitted aggregate events downstream.                                                                       |

#### Empty window padding

Empty window padding emits rows for time ranges that have no events. This is useful for charts and time-series joins that need an explicit zero or null for missing intervals.

| System       | Support | Notes                                   |
| ------------ | ------- | --------------------------------------- |
| TQL          | ❌       | Empty windows are not emitted.          |
| KQL          | ⚠️      | Use manual `range` and `union` padding. |
| SPL          | ✅       | Use `timechart cont=true`.              |
| Cribl Stream | ❌       | No documented empty buckets.            |

#### Session windows

Session windows group events by gaps in activity rather than fixed boundaries. They are useful for user sessions, transactions, and bursts where the end time depends on silence.

| System       | Support | Notes                                                      |
| ------------ | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| TQL          | ❌       | Requires precomputed session IDs or custom stateful logic. |
| KQL          | ✅       | Use `row_window_session()`.                                |
| SPL          | ✅       | Use `transaction maxpause` and `maxspan`.                  |
| Cribl Stream | ❌       | Not native.                                                |

#### Custom alignment or calendar windows

Custom alignment or calendar windows anchor boundaries to a chosen origin or calendar unit. This matters for reports that must align to local business days, weeks, months, or other non-epoch boundaries.

| System       | Support | Notes                                                                                                                |
| ------------ | ------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| TQL          | ⚠️      | Fixed [`window`](/reference/operators/window.md) buckets are epoch-anchored; no custom origin or calendar alignment. |
| KQL          | ✅       | Use `bin_at()`.                                                                                                      |
| SPL          | ✅       | Use `aligntime` and calendar spans.                                                                                  |
| Cribl Stream | ⚠️      | Fixed `Time window` buckets; no documented custom origin or calendar alignment.                                      |

Legend: ✅ native or covered, ⚠️ partial or workaround, ❌ missing.

Cribl Stream’s Aggregations Function runs independently per Worker Process, so aggregate state is not shared globally across workers. [Scheduled Collector jobs](https://docs.cribl.io/stream/collectors/) can run on a recurrence, but they schedule collection work rather than provide a general pipeline Function block.

## Statistical functions

Use statistical aggregation functions for deeper analysis.

### Percentiles and median

Calculate distribution statistics with [`quantile`](/reference/functions/quantile.md):

```tql
from {endpoint: "/api/users", latency: 120},
     {endpoint: "/api/users", latency: 135},
     {endpoint: "/api/users", latency: 110},
     {endpoint: "/api/orders", latency: 245},
     {endpoint: "/api/orders", latency: 225},
     {endpoint: "/api/orders", latency: 280}
summarize p50 = quantile(latency, q=0.5),
          p90 = quantile(latency, q=0.9),
          p95 = quantile(latency, q=0.95),
          endpoint
```

```tql
{
  p50: 245.0,
  p90: 280.0,
  p95: 280.0,
  endpoint: "/api/orders",
}
{
  p50: 120.0,
  p90: 135.0,
  p95: 135.0,
  endpoint: "/api/users",
}
```

### Standard deviation and variance

Measure data spread with [`stddev`](/reference/functions/stddev.md) and [`variance`](/reference/functions/variance.md):

```tql
from {server: "web1", cpu: 45},
     {server: "web1", cpu: 52},
     {server: "web1", cpu: 48},
     {server: "web2", cpu: 85},
     {server: "web2", cpu: 92},
     {server: "web2", cpu: 88}
summarize avg_cpu = mean(cpu),
          cpu_stddev = stddev(cpu),
          cpu_variance = variance(cpu),
          server
```

```tql
{
  avg_cpu: 48.333333333333336,
  cpu_stddev: 2.8674417556808622,
  cpu_variance: 8.222222222222145,
  server: "web1",
}
{
  avg_cpu: 88.33333333333333,
  cpu_stddev: 2.8674417556810217,
  cpu_variance: 8.22222222222306,
  server: "web2",
}
```

### Mode and distinct values

Find most common values and collect unique values with [`mode`](/reference/functions/mode.md), [`distinct`](/reference/functions/distinct.md), and [`count_if`](/reference/functions/count_if.md):

```tql
from {user: "alice", browser: "chrome", action: "login"},
     {user: "bob", browser: "firefox", action: "view"},
     {user: "alice", browser: "chrome", action: "edit"},
     {user: "charlie", browser: "chrome", action: "login"},
     {user: "alice", browser: "safari", action: "login"}
summarize most_common_browser = mode(browser),
          unique_browsers = distinct(browser),
          login_count = count_if(action, x => x == "login")
```

```tql
{
  most_common_browser: "chrome",
  unique_browsers: [
    "chrome",
    "firefox",
    "safari",
  ],
  login_count: 3,
}
```

### Value frequencies and entropy

Analyze value distributions with [`value_counts`](/reference/functions/value_counts.md) and [`entropy`](/reference/functions/entropy.md):

```tql
from {category: "A", value: 10},
     {category: "B", value: 20},
     {category: "A", value: 15},
     {category: "B", value: 25},
     {category: "C", value: 30}
summarize frequencies = value_counts(category),
          info_entropy = entropy(category)
```

```tql
{
  frequencies: [
    {
      value: "A",
      count: 2,
    },
    {
      value: "B",
      count: 2,
    },
    {
      value: "C",
      count: 1,
    },
  ],
  info_entropy: 1.0549201679861442,
}
```

## Collecting values

Use [`collect`](/reference/functions/collect.md) and [`distinct`](/reference/functions/distinct.md) to gather values:

```tql
from {user: "alice", action: "login", timestamp: 2024-01-15T10:00:00},
     {user: "bob", action: "view", timestamp: 2024-01-15T10:01:00},
     {user: "alice", action: "edit", timestamp: 2024-01-15T10:02:00},
     {user: "charlie", action: "login", timestamp: 2024-01-15T10:03:00},
     {user: "alice", action: "logout", timestamp: 2024-01-15T10:04:00}
summarize all_actions = collect(action),
          unique_users = distinct(user),
          event_count = count()
```

```tql
{
  all_actions: [
    "login",
    "view",
    "edit",
    "login",
    "logout",
  ],
  unique_users: [
    "alice",
    "charlie",
    "bob",
  ],
  event_count: 5,
}
```

### First and last values

Get boundary values with [`first`](/reference/functions/first.md) and [`last`](/reference/functions/last.md):

```tql
from {sensor: "temp1", reading: 72, time: 2024-01-15T09:00:00},
     {sensor: "temp1", reading: 75, time: 2024-01-15T10:00:00},
     {sensor: "temp1", reading: 78, time: 2024-01-15T11:00:00},
     {sensor: "temp2", reading: 68, time: 2024-01-15T09:00:00},
     {sensor: "temp2", reading: 71, time: 2024-01-15T10:00:00}
summarize first_reading = first(reading),
          last_reading = last(reading),
          avg_reading = mean(reading),
          sensor
```

```tql
{
  first_reading: 72,
  last_reading: 78,
  avg_reading: 75.0,
  sensor: "temp1",
}
{
  first_reading: 68,
  last_reading: 71,
  avg_reading: 69.5,
  sensor: "temp2",
}
```

### Group and collect values

Use [`collect`](/reference/functions/collect.md) with grouping to build hierarchical structures:

```tql
from {dept: "Engineering", team: "Backend", member: "Alice"},
     {dept: "Engineering", team: "Backend", member: "Bob"},
     {dept: "Engineering", team: "Frontend", member: "Charlie"},
     {dept: "Sales", team: "Direct", member: "David"}
summarize dept, team, members=collect(member)
```

```tql
{
  dept: "Sales",
  team: "Direct",
  members: [
    "David",
  ],
}
{
  dept: "Engineering",
  team: "Frontend",
  members: [
    "Charlie",
  ],
}
{
  dept: "Engineering",
  team: "Backend",
  members: [
    "Alice",
    "Bob",
  ],
}
```

## Boolean aggregations

Use [`all`](/reference/functions/all.md) and [`any`](/reference/functions/any.md) for boolean checks:

```tql
from {test: "unit", passed: true, duration: 45},
     {test: "integration", passed: true, duration: 120},
     {test: "e2e", passed: false, duration: 300},
     {test: "performance", passed: true, duration: 180}
summarize all_passed = all(passed),
          any_failed = any(not passed),
          total_duration = sum(duration)
```

```tql
{
  all_passed: false,
  any_failed: true,
  total_duration: 645
}
```

## Conditional aggregation

Collect values conditionally during aggregation:

```tql
from {src_ip: 10.0.0.5, dst_port: 22, bytes: 1024},
     {src_ip: 192.168.1.10, dst_port: 80, bytes: 2048},
     {src_ip: 10.0.0.5, dst_port: 443, bytes: 4096},
     {src_ip: 192.168.1.10, dst_port: 22, bytes: 512}


let $critical_ports = [22, 3389, 5985]


summarize src_ip,
  total_bytes=sum(bytes),
  // Collect all unique ports
  all_ports=collect(dst_port),
  // Collect with conditional transformation
  port_types=collect("HIGH" if dst_port in $critical_ports else "LOW")
```

```tql
{src_ip: 192.168.1.10, total_bytes: 2560, all_ports: [80, 22], port_types: ["LOW", "HIGH"]}
{src_ip: 10.0.0.5, total_bytes: 5120, all_ports: [22, 443], port_types: ["HIGH", "LOW"]}
```

This pattern enables:

* Building risk profiles during aggregation
* Transforming values during collection based on conditions
* Creating categorical metrics from raw data

## Practical examples

### Analyze API response times

```tql
from {
  requests: [
    {endpoint: "/api/users", method: "GET", duration: 45, status: 200},
    {endpoint: "/api/users", method: "POST", duration: 120, status: 201},
    {endpoint: "/api/orders", method: "GET", duration: 89, status: 200},
    {endpoint: "/api/users", method: "GET", duration: 38, status: 200},
    {endpoint: "/api/orders", method: "GET", duration: 156, status: 500}
  ]
}
unroll requests
summarize endpoint=requests.endpoint,
          count=count(),
          avg_duration=mean(requests.duration)
```

```tql
{
  endpoint: "/api/orders",
  count: 2,
  avg_duration: 122.5,
}
{
  endpoint: "/api/users",
  count: 3,
  avg_duration: 67.66666666666667,
}
```

### Calculate sales metrics

```tql
from {
  sales: [
    {date: "2024-01-01", amount: 1200, region: "North"},
    {date: "2024-01-01", amount: 800, region: "South"},
    {date: "2024-01-02", amount: 1500, region: "North"},
    {date: "2024-01-02", amount: 950, region: "South"},
    {date: "2024-01-03", amount: 1100, region: "North"}
  ]
}
// Calculate totals by date
unroll sales
summarize date=sales.date, total=sum(sales.amount)
```

```tql
{date: "2024-01-01", total: 2000}
{date: "2024-01-02", total: 2450}
{date: "2024-01-03", total: 1100}
```

### Monitor system health

```tql
from {
  metrics: [
    {timestamp: "10:00", cpu: 45, memory: 62, disk: 78},
    {timestamp: "10:01", cpu: 52, memory: 64, disk: 78},
    {timestamp: "10:02", cpu: 89, memory: 71, disk: 79},
    {timestamp: "10:03", cpu: 67, memory: 68, disk: 79},
    {timestamp: "10:04", cpu: 48, memory: 65, disk: 80}
  ]
}
cpu_alert = metrics.map(m => m.cpu > 80).any()
avg_memory = metrics.map(m => m.memory).mean()
disk_trend = metrics.last().disk - metrics.first().disk
health_summary = {
  cpu_max: metrics.map(m => m.cpu).max(),
  memory_avg: avg_memory,
  disk_growth: disk_trend,
  critical: cpu_alert
}
```

```tql
{
  metrics: [ ... ],
  cpu_alert: true,
  avg_memory: 66.0,
  disk_trend: 2,
  health_summary: {
    cpu_max: 89,
    memory_avg: 66.0,
    disk_growth: 2,
    critical: true,
  },
}
```

## Complex aggregations

Combine multiple aggregation functions for comprehensive analysis:

```tql
from {method: "GET", endpoint: "/api/users", status: 200, duration: 45},
     {method: "POST", endpoint: "/api/users", status: 201, duration: 120},
     {method: "GET", endpoint: "/api/orders", status: 200, duration: 89},
     {method: "GET", endpoint: "/api/users", status: 200, duration: 38},
     {method: "GET", endpoint: "/api/orders", status: 500, duration: 156},
     {method: "DELETE", endpoint: "/api/users/123", status: 204, duration: 67}
summarize request_count = count(),
          avg_duration = mean(duration),
          error_count = count_if(status, s => s >= 400),
          unique_endpoints = count_distinct(endpoint),
          method
error_rate = error_count / request_count
```

```tql
{
  request_count: 1,
  avg_duration: 120.0,
  error_count: 0,
  unique_endpoints: 1,
  method: "POST",
  error_rate: 0.0,
}
{
  request_count: 1,
  avg_duration: 67.0,
  error_count: 0,
  unique_endpoints: 1,
  method: "DELETE",
  error_rate: 0.0,
}
{
  request_count: 4,
  avg_duration: 82.0,
  error_count: 1,
  unique_endpoints: 2,
  method: "GET",
  error_rate: 0.25,
}
```

## Best practices

1. **Choose appropriate functions**: Use [`mean`](/reference/functions/mean.md) for averages, [`median`](/reference/functions/median.md) for skewed data
2. **Handle empty collections**: Check if lists are empty before aggregating
3. **Consider memory usage**: Large collections can consume significant memory
4. **Combine aggregations**: Calculate multiple statistics in one pass for efficiency
