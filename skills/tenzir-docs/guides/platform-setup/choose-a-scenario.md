# Choose a scenario


We provide several examples of possible platform deployment scenarios. Pick one that best suits your needs.

## Download the platform files

Start by downloading the [latest Tenzir Platform release](https://github.com/tenzir/platform/releases/latest) and unpack the archive.

## Choose a scenario

The `examples` directory contains example scenarios in the form of Docker Compose configurations. Choose from the following options:

1. **localdev**: This scenario is designed for local development and testing purposes. It operates as a “Tenzir-in-a-box,” meaning all necessary components are bundled together for a quick and easy setup, making it ideal for single-user exploration and experimentation. Due to its simplified nature and focus on ease of use, it has a low barrier to entry. However, it is not optimized for performance, security, or scalability, making it ill-suited for production environments.
2. **keycloak**: The `keycloak` scenario provides a minimal yet complete setup for multi-user environments. It integrates Keycloak for robust authentication and authorization, enabling secure access for multiple users. This configuration includes all essential Tenzir services and is designed to be readily usable, especially when deployed behind a reverse proxy, which can handle TLS termination and provide an additional layer of security and load balancing.
3. **onprem**: Our `onprem` scenario represents an enterprise-grade deployment. It is structured with the assumption that critical services such as Kafka, S3, and the identity provider (like Keycloak) are already established and managed externally within your on-premises infrastructure. This allows Tenzir to integrate seamlessly into existing robust, production-ready environments, leveraging your organization’s established operational practices and infrastructure investments.

To customize a scenario to your needs, configure the services by populating a `.env` file with your settings as environment variables.
