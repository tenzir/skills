# Configure identity provider


The identity provider (IdP) handles authentication for the Tenzir Platform. When you click the *Login* button in the Tenzir UI, the system redirects you to your chosen identity provider, which creates a signed token that certifies your identity.

You can either use an external identity provider that’s already set up inside your organization, or run an identity provider that’s bundled with our example `docker-compose.yaml`.

The Tenzir Platform supports the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol for external identity providers. Below, we describe the requirements for using a generic identity provider, as well as two hands-on guides for setting up Keycloak and Entra ID as identity providers for the Tenzir Platform.

## Generic Identity Provider

To use an external IdP, ensure that it supports the OIDC protocol, including the *OIDC Discovery* extension, and configure it to provide valid RS256 ID tokens.

Set up the external identity provider by creating two clients (also called applications in Auth0, or app registrations in Microsoft Entra) named `tenzir-app` and `tenzir-cli`.

The `tenzir-app` client handles logging into the Tenzir Platform in the web browser.

* You must enable the **Authorization Code** flow.
* The allowed redirect URLs must include `https://app.platform.example/login/oauth/callback`.
* You should note down the client secret so you can add it to the configuration of the Tenzir Platform in the next step.

The `tenzir-cli` client handles authentication with the `tenzir-platform` CLI.

* You must enable the **Device Code** flow.
* The identity provider must either return an `id_token` for the device code flow, or an `access_token` in JWT format.

You may want to run CLI commands in environments where no user is available to perform the device code authorization flow, for example when you run CLI commands as part of a CI job.

In this case, you can set up another client with the **Client Credentials** flow enabled. The `access_token` you obtain from this client must be in JWT format. The CLI automatically attempts to use the client credentials flow if the `TENZIR_PLATFORM_CLI_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variable is set. You can also force the use of the client credentials flow by using the `tenzir-platform auth login --non-interactive` option.

You must provide the following environment variables for the OIDC provider configuration used for logging into the platform:

```sh
TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_PROVIDER_NAME=example-idp
TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_PROVIDER_ISSUER_URL=https://my.idp.example


TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_CLI_CLIENT_ID=tenzir-cli


TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_APP_CLIENT_ID=tenzir-app
TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_APP_CLIENT_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
```

You must provide the following environment variable containing a JSON object with the OIDC issuer and audiences that the platform should accept. You can also provide an array of objects to configure multiple trusted issuers.

```sh
# Single issuer configuration
TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_TRUSTED_AUDIENCES='{"issuer": "http://platform.local:3004/realms/master","audiences": ["tenzir-app"]}'


# Multiple issuers configuration
TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_TRUSTED_AUDIENCES='[
  {"issuer": "https://accounts.google.com", "audiences": ["audience1"]},
  {"issuer": "http://platform.local:3004/realms/master", "audiences": ["tenzir-app"]}
]'
```

## Keycloak

This section explains how to configure Keycloak as an external Identity Provider for use with the Tenzir Platform.

We assume that you already have a Keycloak instance up and running that you can reach with a browser. We provide an example stack of the Tenzir Platform with a bundled Keycloak instance [here](https://github.com/tenzir/platform/tree/main/examples/keycloak). The remainder of this section assumes you’re running this example stack, but the setup is the same for any other Keycloak instance.

### Setting up the Keycloak Instance

#### Admin Login

Navigate to the Keycloak instance and log in as a user with admin permissions. If you use the bundled Keycloak instance, the initial username is `admin` and password is `changeme`.

Remember to change the default password after logging in for the first time, and to set up 2-factor authentication for your admin user.

#### Create a new `tenzir` realm (optional)

Keycloak defaults to the `master` realm and the bundled Docker Compose stack uses this realm by default.

If you want to use a different realm, or if you already have an existing one, update the `TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_ISSUER_URL` variable to point to the new realm instead.

#### Create a client for the app

Use the `Add Client` button in the `Clients` menu on the left. Configure the new client as follows:

Under *General settings*, set the client type to *OpenID Connect* and the client ID to `tenzir-app`. If you use a different client ID, remember to update the `TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_PROVIDER_CLIENT_ID` variable in your Tenzir Platform configuration accordingly.

Under *Capability config*, enable client authentication and the *Standard flow* access method.

Under *Login settings*, enter a redirect URL that points to `${TENZIR_PLATFORM_DOMAIN}/login/oauth/callback`, where `TENZIR_PLATFORM_DOMAIN` is the domain you configure in your Tenzir Platform configuration. For example, if the app runs under `https://tenzir-app.example.org` then this should be `https://tenzir-app.example.org/login/oauth/callback`.

Finally, in the client view, go to the Credentials tab and copy the value of the generated client secret. You must add this to the Tenzir Platform configuration under `TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_PROVIDER_CLIENT_SECRET`.

### Create a client for the CLI

To use the `tenzir-platform` CLI, you need to set up an additional client that supports device code authentication. (It’s possible but not recommended to use the same client for both the Tenzir UI and Tenzir Platform CLI)

To do this, proceed exactly as above, but use `tenzir-cli` as the client ID and under *Capability config* disable the *Client authentication* setting and enable the *OAuth 2.0 Device Authorization Grant* authentication flow.

## Microsoft Entra Identity

To use Microsoft Entra Identity as an OIDC provider, you need to create two app registrations in Entra ID and configure them for use with the Tenzir UI and the Tenzir Platform CLI.

Follow these steps to create the required resources:

1. Navigate to `portal.azure.com` and open the page for “Microsoft Entra ID”.

2. Open the “App registrations” sub page.

3. Create a new registration named `Tenzir Platform CLI`.

4. Enable the public client flows for this app.

5. Create a second registration named `Tenzir UI`.

6. For this registration, open “Certificates & Secrets”.

7. Create a new secret and give it a descriptive name.

8. Make a local copy of the secret value.

9. Copy the client id to your local machine.

10. Copy the issuer url to your local machine.

Now you can supply the created resources and values to the stack by editing the `.env` file in your Compose folder:

```sh
TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_PROVIDER_NAME="Entra ID"


# The client id of the registration created in step 3.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_CLI_CLIENT_ID=082a9391-b645-4278-a16e-3cf54fb1bcf0


# The client id and secret created in steps 8 and 9.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_APP_CLIENT_SECRET=xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx
TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_APP_CLIENT_ID=d8ea5612-6745-47bc-b9fe-5024b1ca18fe


# The issuer url copied in step 10.
TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_PROVIDER_ISSUER_URL=https://login.microsoftonline.com/40431729-d276-4582-abb4-01e21c8b58fe/v2.0
TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_TRUSTED_AUDIENCES='{"issuer": "https://login.microsoftonline.com/40431729-d276-4582-abb4-01e21c8b58fe/v2.0","audiences": ["d8ea5612-6745-47bc-b9fe-5024b1ca18fe", "082a9391-b645-4278-a16e-3cf54fb1bcf0"]}'
```

Now you can restart your Tenzir Platform stack and the system will redirect you to a Microsoft login page when you next log in to the Tenzir UI.

### Additional Configuration for Client Credentials Flow (Optional)

If you plan to use the client credentials flow for non-interactive CLI usage, you need to configure additional settings for the CLI registration created in step 3:

11. Navigate to “Expose an API” and add an Application ID URI (you can use the suggested default value).

12. Navigate to “Manifest” and update the `requestedAccessTokenVersion` to `2` in the JSON manifest, then save the changes.

13. When using the client credentials flow with this registration, you must override the scope by setting `TENZIR_PLATFORM_CLI_SCOPE` to `${APPLICATION_ID_URL}/.default`, where `${APPLICATION_ID_URL}` is the Application ID URI you configured in step 11.

## Single-user Mode

In some scenarios handling multiple users is not necessary for the Tenzir Platform. For example for purely local instances used for development or experimentation, or where access is already gated through some external mechanism.

For these situations, the Tenzir Platform offers the single-user mode. In this mode, the Tenzir Platform itself acts as the identity provider, and creates a static, global admin user with no password.

To stress, this means that everyone who can reach the Tenzir Platform will have full access to every Tenzir Node and every workspace, so this is not suitable for generic production deployments.

To use the single-user mode, we recommend starting from [this](https://github.com/tenzir/platform/tree/main/examples/localdev) example setup. This example is already fully configured and can run as-is, skipping the manual configuration described in the sections below.

### Tenzir Platform API

In terms of configuration, the `platform` service needs to be put into single-user mode by setting the `TENANT_MANAGER_AUTH__SINGLE_USER_MODE` environment variable to true.

Additionally, the platform needs to have additional configuration that would usually be configured in the external identity provider, in particular the issuer url it should use for signing its own JWTs and the allowed redirect URLs and audiences of the UI and CLI:

```sh
TENANT_MANAGER_AUTH__SINGLE_USER_MODE=true


TENANT_MANAGER_AUTH__ISSUER_URL=http://platform:5000/oidc
TENANT_MANAGER_AUTH__PUBLIC_BASE_URL=${TENZIR_PLATFORM_API_ENDPOINT}/oidc
TENANT_MANAGER_AUTH__APP_AUDIENCE=tenzir-app
TENANT_MANAGER_AUTH__APP_REDIRECT_URLS=${TENZIR_PLATFORM_UI_ENDPOINT}/login/oauth/callback
TENANT_MANAGER_AUTH__CLI_AUDIENCE=tenzir-cli
```

### Tenzir UI

The Tenzir UI needs to be pointed to the `platform` service as the new identity provider.

Since the single-user mode does not provide true user authentication, the corresponding client secret is also not truly secret but set to the static string “xxxx”.

```sh
PRIVATE_OIDC_PROVIDER_NAME=tenzir
PRIVATE_OIDC_PROVIDER_CLIENT_ID=tenzir-app
PRIVATE_OIDC_PROVIDER_CLIENT_SECRET=xxxx
PRIVATE_OIDC_PROVIDER_ISSUER_URL=http://platform:5000/oidc
```

### Tenzir Platform CLI

In single-user mode, the Tenzir Platform CLI can be set to non-interactive mode by adding the `TENZIR_PLATFORM_CLI_CLIENT_SECRET` environment variable.

Note that when running the Tenzir Platform inside a docker compose stack, in single-user mode the CLI must run the same docker compose stack as the platform. When running outside of docker compose, the requirement is that the CLI must be able to establish a network connection to the configured ISSUER\_URL.

```sh
TENZIR_PLATFORM_CLI_CLIENT_ID=tenzir-cli
TENZIR_PLATFORM_CLI_CLIENT_SECRET=xxxx
TENZIR_PLATFORM_CLI_ISSUER_URL=http://platform:5000/oidc
```

## Advanced Topics

### Custom Scopes

By default, the Tenzir Platform requests the `profile email openid offline_access` scopes when you log in. To adjust this, set the `PUBLIC_OIDC_SCOPES` environment variable to a space-separated list of scope names.

### Profile Pictures

To include custom profile pictures, include a `picture` claim in the returned ID token that contains a URL to the image file.

The Tenzir Platform reads that claim and uses it as the profile picture in the top right corner of the user interface, or falls back to a default image if the claim isn’t present.

### Refresh Tokens

The Tenzir Platform supports the use of refresh tokens and by default requests the `offline_access` scope to automatically refresh sessions after the initial ID token has expired. To this end, the `offline_access` scope is requested by default.

Unfortunately, the OIDC spec is ambiguous on the precise semantics of the `offline_access` scope, and Keycloak’s interpretation differs from most other OIDC providers: it always includes refresh tokens by default, and adds additional permissions to the token when the `offline_access` scope is requested.

Therefore, some organizations forbid the use of tokens with `offline_access` permissions for security reasons. In that case, add an environment variable `PUBLIC_OIDC_SCOPES=profile email oidc` to the `app` environment to explicitly remove the scope request. The bundled Docker Compose file in this directory does this by default.

### External JWT Authentication

The Tenzir Platform supports authentication using externally-supplied JWTs, which is useful for scenarios where the platform runs behind a proxy that handles authentication, such as Google Cloud IAP or other enterprise proxies.

To configure external JWT authentication, add the `PRIVATE_JWT_FROM_HEADER` environment variable with the name of the HTTP header that contains the JWT token to the environment of the Tenzir UI:

```sh
PRIVATE_JWT_FROM_HEADER=X-Goog-IAP-JWT-Assertion
```

You must also configure the trusted issuers and audiences using the `TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_TRUSTED_AUDIENCES` environment variable. This variable accepts a JSON object or array of objects containing the issuer and audiences that the platform should accept:

```sh
# Single issuer configuration
TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_TRUSTED_AUDIENCES='{"issuer": "https://cloud.google.com/iap", "audiences": ["your-audience"]}'


# Multiple issuers configuration
TENZIR_PLATFORM_OIDC_TRUSTED_AUDIENCES='[
  {"issuer": "https://accounts.google.com", "audiences": ["audience1"]},
  {"issuer": "https://cloud.google.com/iap", "audiences": ["audience2"]}
]'
```
