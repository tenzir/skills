# Filter and select data


Filtering and selecting are fundamental operations when working with data streams. This guide shows you how to filter events based on conditions and select specific fields from your data.

## Understanding operators vs functions

Before we dive in, it’s important to understand a key distinction in TQL:

* **Operators** like [`where`](../../reference/operators/where.md), [`select`](../../reference/operators/select.md), and [`drop`](../../reference/operators/drop.md) work on entire event streams
* **Functions** like [`starts_with()`](../../reference/functions/starts_with.md) or mathematical comparisons work on individual values within events

You’ll see both in action throughout this guide.

## Filter events with conditions

Use the [`where`](../../reference/operators/where.md) operator to keep only events that match specific conditions.

### Basic filtering

Filter events based on a simple condition. This example keeps only successful HTTP requests (status code 200):

```tql
from {status: 200, path: "/api/users"},
     {status: 404, path: "/api/missing"},
     {status: 200, path: "/home"}
where status == 200
```

```tql
{status: 200, path: "/api/users"}
{status: 200, path: "/home"}
```

The event with `status: 404` is filtered out because it doesn’t match our condition.

### Combining conditions

Use logical operators (`and`, `or`, `not`) to combine multiple conditions:

```tql
from {status: 200, path: "/api/users", size: 1024},
     {status: 404, path: "/api/missing", size: 512},
     {status: 200, path: "/home", size: 2048}
where status == 200 and size > 1000
```

```tql
{status: 200, path: "/api/users", size: 1024}
{status: 200, path: "/home", size: 2048}
```

You can also use `or` and `not` with functions like [`starts_with()`](../../reference/functions/starts_with.md):

```tql
from {status: 200, path: "/api/users"},
     {status: 404, path: "/api/missing"},
     {status: 500, path: "/api/error"}
where status == 200 or not path.starts_with("/api/m")
```

```tql
{status: 200, path: "/api/users"}
{status: 500, path: "/api/error"}
```

### Using functions in filters

Functions work on values to create more sophisticated filters. For example, [`ends_with()`](../../reference/functions/ends_with.md) checks string suffixes:

```tql
from {user: "alice", email: "alice@example.com"},
     {user: "bob", email: "bob@gmail.com"},
     {user: "charlie", email: "charlie@example.com"}
where email.ends_with("example.com")
```

```tql
{user: "alice", email: "alice@example.com"}
{user: "charlie", email: "charlie@example.com"}
```

### Filtering with patterns

Match patterns using regular expressions with [`match_regex()`](../../reference/functions/match_regex.md):

```tql
from {log: "Error: Connection timeout"},
     {log: "Info: Request processed"},
     {log: "Error: Invalid input"}
where log.match_regex("Error:")
```

```tql
{log: "Error: Connection timeout"}
{log: "Error: Invalid input"}
```

## Select specific fields

The [`select`](../../reference/operators/select.md) operator lets you pick which fields to keep in your output.

### Basic field selection

Select only the fields you need:

```tql
from {name: "alice", age: 30, city: "NYC"},
     {name: "bob", age: 25, city: "SF"}
select name, age
```

```tql
{name: "alice", age: 30}
{name: "bob", age: 25}
```

### Renaming fields

You can rename fields while selecting them. This is useful when standardizing field names from different data sources:

```tql
from {first_name: "alice", years: 30},
     {first_name: "bob", years: 25}
select name=first_name, age=years
```

```tql
{name: "alice", age: 30}
{name: "bob", age: 25}
```

Here `first_name` becomes `name` and `years` becomes `age` in the output.

Note that `select` restricts the output to only the listed fields. If you want to rename fields while keeping everything else, use an assignment with [`move`](../../reference/expressions.md#moving-fields) instead.

### Computing new fields

Create new fields with expressions during selection:

```tql
from {price: 100, tax_rate: 0.08},
     {price: 50, tax_rate: 0.08}
select price, tax=price * tax_rate, total=price * (1 + tax_rate)
```

```tql
{price: 100, tax: 8.0, total: 108.0}
{price: 50, tax: 4.0, total: 54.0}
```

## Remove unwanted fields

The [`drop`](../../reference/operators/drop.md) operator removes specified fields, keeping everything else.

### Basic field removal

Remove fields you don’t need:

```tql
from {user: "alice", password: "secret", email: "alice@example.com"},
     {user: "bob", password: "hidden", email: "bob@example.com"}
drop password
```

```tql
{user: "alice", email: "alice@example.com"}
{user: "bob", email: "bob@example.com"}
```

### Dropping multiple fields

Remove several fields at once:

```tql
from {id: 1, internal_id: "xyz", debug: true, name: "alice"},
     {id: 2, internal_id: "abc", debug: false, name: "bob"}
drop internal_id, debug
```

```tql
{id: 1, name: "alice"}
{id: 2, name: "bob"}
```

## Add computed fields

Use the [`set`](../../reference/operators/set.md) operator to override existing fields and add new fields without removing existing ones.

Implied operator

The [`set`](../../reference/operators/set.md) operator is *implied*, i.e., you can omit it to keep your pipeline definitions terse. In other words, it suffices to write an assignment in the form `x = y` instead of `set x = y`.

### Adding simple fields

Add a constant field to all events:

```tql
from {user: "alice"},
     {user: "bob"}
set source = "api"
```

```tql
{user: "alice", source: "api"}
{user: "bob", source: "api"}
```

### Computing field values

Add fields based on calculations:

```tql
from {bytes_sent: 1024, bytes_received: 2048},
     {bytes_sent: 512, bytes_received: 1024}
set total_bytes = bytes_sent + bytes_received
```

```tql
{bytes_sent: 1024, bytes_received: 2048, total_bytes: 3072}
{bytes_sent: 512, bytes_received: 1024, total_bytes: 1536}
```

### Using the `else` keyword

Use the `else` word to provide default values for null fields:

```tql
from {name: "alice", score: 85},
     {name: "bob"},
     {name: "charlie", score: 95}
score = score? else 0
```

```tql
{name: "alice", score: 85}
{name: "bob", score: 0}
{name: "charlie", score: 95}
```

Accessing non-existent fields

Because the second event had no `score` field, the `else` keyword filled in a default value of `0`. However, accessing non-existent fields generates a warning. We use the trailing question mark (`?`) to suppress warnings when accessing fields that may not exist, i.e., `score? else 0` in the above example. This is distinctively different from an existing field with a null value, which does not elicit a warning.

## Rename fields

TQL has no dedicated `rename` operator. Instead, use the [`move`](../../reference/expressions.md#moving-fields) keyword in an assignment to relocate a value from one field to another, removing the original:

```tql
from {first_name: "alice", years: 30, city: "NYC"},
     {first_name: "bob", years: 25, city: "SF"}
name = move first_name
age = move years
```

```tql
{city: "NYC", name: "alice", age: 30}
{city: "SF", name: "bob", age: 25}
```

Unlike [`select`](../../reference/operators/select.md), which restricts the output to only the listed fields, an assignment with `move` preserves all other fields.

### Renaming into nested fields

You can move fields into nested structures:

```tql
from {src_ip: 1.2.3.4, src_port: 443}
src.ip = move src_ip
src.port = move src_port
```

```tql
{src: {ip: 1.2.3.4, port: 443}}
```

## Combining operations

Real-world pipelines often combine multiple operations:

```tql
from {method: "GET", path: "/api/users", status: 200, duration_ms: 45},
     {method: "POST", path: "/api/users", status: 201, duration_ms: 120},
     {method: "GET", path: "/api/users/123", status: 404, duration_ms: 15}
where status >= 200 and status < 300
select method, path, duration = duration_ms.milliseconds()
```

```tql
{method: "GET", path: "/api/users", duration: 45ms}
{method: "POST", path: "/api/users", duration: 120ms}
```

## Best practices

1. **Filter early**: Apply [`where`](../../reference/operators/where.md) conditions as early as possible to reduce the amount of data flowing through your pipeline.

2. **Select only what you need**: Use [`select`](../../reference/operators/select.md) to keep only necessary fields, especially when dealing with large events.

3. **Choose the right operator**:

   * Use [`select`](../../reference/operators/select.md) when you want to restrict the output to specific fields.
   * Use [`drop`](../../reference/operators/drop.md) when you want to remove a few fields from many.
   * Use [`set`](../../reference/operators/set.md) when you want to add/override fields without changing existing ones.
   * Use an assignment with `move` when you want to rename fields without affecting the rest of the event.

4. **Understand null handling**: The [`where`](../../reference/operators/where.md) operator skips events where the condition evaluates to null or false. Use the question mark operator (`?`) to suppress warnings when accessing fields that may not exist.
