# Deduplicate events


The [`deduplicate`](/reference/operators/deduplicate.md) operator provides a powerful mechanism to remove duplicate events in a pipeline.

There are numerous use cases for deduplication, such as reducing noise, optimizing costs and making threat detection and response more efficient.

## Basic deduplication

Let’s start with a simple example to understand how deduplication works. Imagine you’re monitoring user logins and want to see only unique users, regardless of how many times they log in:

```tql
from {user: "alice", action: "login", time: 1},
     {user: "bob", action: "login", time: 2},
     {user: "alice", action: "login", time: 3},
     {user: "alice", action: "logout", time: 4}
deduplicate user
```

```tql
{user: "alice", action: "login", time: 1}
{user: "bob", action: "login", time: 2}
```

The operator keeps only the first occurrence of each unique value for the specified field(s). In this example:

* Alice’s first login (time: 1) is kept
* Bob’s login (time: 2) is kept
* Alice’s second login (time: 3) is dropped because we already saw `user: "alice"`
* Note that Alice’s logout (time: 4) would also be dropped with this simple deduplication

## Deduplicate by multiple fields

Often you need more nuanced deduplication. For example, you might want to track unique user-action pairs to see each distinct activity per user:

```tql
from {user: "alice", action: "login", time: 1},
     {user: "bob", action: "login", time: 2},
     {user: "alice", action: "login", time: 3},
     {user: "alice", action: "logout", time: 4}
deduplicate user, action
```

```tql
{user: "alice", action: "login", time: 1}
{user: "bob", action: "login", time: 2}
{user: "alice", action: "logout", time: 4}
```

Now we keep unique combinations of user and action:

* Alice’s first login is kept (unique: alice+login)
* Bob’s login is kept (unique: bob+login)
* Alice’s second login is dropped (duplicate: alice+login already seen)
* Alice’s logout is kept (unique: alice+logout is a new combination)

This approach is useful for tracking distinct user activities rather than just unique users.

## Analyze unique host pairs

When investigating network incidents, you often want to identify all unique communication patterns between hosts. This example shows network connections with nested ID fields containing origin and response hosts:

```tql
from {id: {orig_h: 10.0.0.1, resp_h: 192.168.1.1}, bytes: 1024},
     {id: {orig_h: 10.0.0.2, resp_h: 192.168.1.1}, bytes: 2048},
     {id: {orig_h: 10.0.0.1, resp_h: 192.168.1.1}, bytes: 512},
     {id: {orig_h: 10.0.0.1, resp_h: 192.168.1.2}, bytes: 256}
deduplicate id.orig_h, id.resp_h
```

```tql
{id: {orig_h: 10.0.0.1, resp_h: 192.168.1.1}, bytes: 1024}
{id: {orig_h: 10.0.0.2, resp_h: 192.168.1.1}, bytes: 2048}
{id: {orig_h: 10.0.0.1, resp_h: 192.168.1.2}, bytes: 256}
```

The deduplication works on the extracted host pairs:

* First connection (10.0.0.1 → 192.168.1.1) is kept
* Second connection (10.0.0.2 → 192.168.1.1) is kept (different origin)
* Third connection (10.0.0.1 → 192.168.1.1) is dropped (duplicate of first)
* Fourth connection (10.0.0.1 → 192.168.1.2) is kept (different destination)

Note that flipped connections (A→B vs B→A) are considered different pairs. This helps identify bidirectional communication patterns.

## Remove duplicate alerts

Security monitoring often generates duplicate alerts that create noise and fatigue. Here’s how to suppress repeated alerts for the same threat pattern:

```tql
from {src_ip: 10.0.0.1, dest_ip: 8.8.8.8, signature: "Suspicious DNS", time: 1},
     {src_ip: 10.0.0.1, dest_ip: 8.8.8.8, signature: "Suspicious DNS", time: 2},
     {src_ip: 10.0.0.2, dest_ip: 8.8.8.8, signature: "Suspicious DNS", time: 3},
     {src_ip: 10.0.0.1, dest_ip: 8.8.8.8, signature: "Port Scan", time: 4}
deduplicate src_ip, dest_ip, signature
```

```tql
{src_ip: 10.0.0.1, dest_ip: 8.8.8.8, signature: "Suspicious DNS", time: 1}
{src_ip: 10.0.0.2, dest_ip: 8.8.8.8, signature: "Suspicious DNS", time: 3}
{src_ip: 10.0.0.1, dest_ip: 8.8.8.8, signature: "Port Scan", time: 4}
```

The deduplication creates a composite key from source, destination, and signature:

* First “Suspicious DNS” from 10.0.0.1 is kept
* Second identical alert (time: 2) is suppressed as a duplicate
* “Suspicious DNS” from different source 10.0.0.2 is kept (different pattern)
* “Port Scan” from 10.0.0.1 is kept (different signature)

This approach reduces alert volume while preserving visibility into distinct threat patterns.

### Using timeout for time-based deduplication

In production environments, you often want to suppress duplicates only within a certain time window. This ensures you don’t miss recurring issues that happen over longer periods.

The `create_timeout` parameter resets the deduplication state after the specified duration:

```tql
deduplicate src_ip, dest_ip, signature, create_timeout=1h
```

This configuration:

* Suppresses duplicate alerts for the same source/destination/signature combination
* Resets after 1 hour, allowing the same alert pattern through again
* Helps balance noise reduction with visibility into persistent threats

For example, if a host is repeatedly targeted:

* 9:00 AM: First “Port Scan” alert is shown
* 9:15 AM: Duplicate suppressed
* 9:30 AM: Duplicate suppressed
* 10:05 AM: Same alert shown again (timeout expired)

## Tracking dropped events

Sometimes you need visibility into how many duplicates were suppressed. The `count_field` option adds a field to each output event showing the number of dropped events for that deduplication key.

### Monitoring alert suppression

When deduplicating security alerts, you may want to know how many duplicates were suppressed to understand the volume of repeated activity:

```tql
from {src_ip: 10.0.0.1, signature: "Port Scan", time: 1},
     {src_ip: 10.0.0.1, signature: "Port Scan", time: 2},
     {src_ip: 10.0.0.1, signature: "Port Scan", time: 3},
     {src_ip: 10.0.0.2, signature: "Port Scan", time: 4},
     {src_ip: 10.0.0.2, signature: "Port Scan", time: 5},
     {src_ip: 10.0.0.1, signature: "Port Scan", time: 6}
deduplicate src_ip, signature, distance=2, count_field=suppressed
```

```tql
{src_ip: 10.0.0.1, signature: "Port Scan", time: 1, suppressed: 0}
{src_ip: 10.0.0.2, signature: "Port Scan", time: 4, suppressed: 0}
{src_ip: 10.0.0.1, signature: "Port Scan", time: 6, suppressed: 2}
```

The `suppressed` field shows how many events were dropped for each key:

* First alert from `10.0.0.1` passes with `suppressed: 0`
* Alerts at times 2 and 3 are suppressed (duplicates within distance)
* Alert from `10.0.0.2` passes with `suppressed: 0` (different key)
* At time 6, `10.0.0.1` reappears after the distance threshold, showing `suppressed: 2` for the two dropped events

In production, combine `count_field` with `create_timeout` for time-based deduplication:

```tql
deduplicate src_ip, signature, create_timeout=1h, count_field=suppressed
```

A high suppression count indicates persistent activity from a specific source, such as ongoing scanning attempts or noisy sensors.

## Best practices

1. **Choose fields carefully**: Deduplicate on fields that truly identify unique events for your use case. Too few fields may drop important events; too many may not deduplicate effectively.

2. **Consider order**: The [`deduplicate`](/reference/operators/deduplicate.md) operator keeps the *first* occurrence. If you need the latest, consider using [`reverse`](/reference/operators/reverse.md) first:

   ```tql
   reverse | deduplicate user | reverse
   ```

3. **Use timeout wisely**: For streaming data, `create_timeout` prevents memory from growing indefinitely while still reducing noise. Choose durations based on your threat detection windows.

4. **Combine with other operators**: Often you’ll want to filter ([`where`](/reference/operators/where.md)) or transform ([`set`](/reference/operators/set.md)) data before deduplication to normalize keys:

   ```tql
   normalized_ip = src_ip.string()
   deduplicate normalized_ip
   ```

5. **Track suppression for context**: Use `count_field` when you need visibility into duplicate volume, especially for security monitoring where the number of repeated events can indicate severity or persistence of threats.

## Coming from Cribl?

If you’re familiar with [Cribl’s Suppress function](https://docs.cribl.io/stream/suppress-function/), here’s how Tenzir’s `deduplicate` compares:

| Feature               | Cribl `suppress`                   | Tenzir `deduplicate`            |
| --------------------- | ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Key-based suppression | `keyExpr`                          | `keys…`                         |
| Allow N events        | `numEventsToAllow` (default: 1)    | `limit` (default: 1)            |
| Time-based window     | `suppressPeriodSec` (default: 30s) | `create_timeout` (no default)   |
| Count dropped events  | `suppressCount` (automatic)        | `count_field` (explicit)        |
| Position-based window | ❌                                  | `distance`                      |
| Drop vs. tag mode     | `dropEventsMode` toggle            | always drops                    |
| Fine-grained timeouts | ❌                                  | `write_timeout`, `read_timeout` |

Tenzir’s `deduplicate` offers several advantages:

* **Flexible deduplication modes**: Beyond time-based windows, Tenzir supports position-based deduplication via `distance`—useful when event order matters more than wall-clock time.
* **Precise timeout control**: Three distinct timeout types (`create_timeout`, `write_timeout`, `read_timeout`) give you fine-grained control over when suppression state resets.
* **No arbitrary defaults**: Tenzir doesn’t impose a default timeout, letting you choose the right behavior for your use case rather than inheriting a 30-second window you might not want.
* **Explicit is better**: The `count_field` parameter makes suppression tracking opt-in, keeping your schema clean when you don’t need it.
