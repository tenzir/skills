# Manage organizations


This guide shows you how to create, configure, and delete organizations in the Tenzir Platform. You’ll learn how to perform these tasks through both the web app and the CLI.

Availability

Organizations require the **Professional Edition** or higher. See [tenzir.com/pricing](https://tenzir.com/pricing) for details.

## Create an organization

Each user can belong to at most one organization. When you create an organization, you automatically become its first admin.

### Web app

### CLI

```sh
tenzir-platform org create "Acme Corp"
```

The command outputs the new organization’s ID.

## View organization details

### Web app

Navigate to **Organizations** in the sidebar to see your organization’s overview, including the name, member count, and creation date.

### CLI

```sh
tenzir-platform org info
```

This displays the organization name, ID, number of members, and pending invitations. Only admins can see pending invitations.

## Update organization settings

Admins can change the organization name and icon.

### Web app

Click the organization name on the organization page to edit it inline. You can also update the icon URL in the settings section.

### CLI

Organization settings can currently only be updated through the web app.

## Delete an organization

Destructive action

Deleting an organization permanently removes it along with **all of its workspaces** and their contents. This action cannot be undone.

Only admins can delete an organization.

### Web app

Scroll to the **Danger Zone** at the bottom of the organization page and click **Delete Organization**. A confirmation dialog asks you to confirm before proceeding.

### CLI

```sh
tenzir-platform org delete
```
