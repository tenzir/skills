# Manage organization members


This guide shows you how to invite people to your organization, manage existing members, and understand the role-based permission model. You’ll learn how to use both the web app and the CLI for these tasks.

## Roles and permissions

Organizations have two roles:

| Capability                     | Admin | Member |
| ------------------------------ | :---: | :----: |
| View organization details      |   ✓   |    ✓   |
| Access organization workspaces |   ✓   |    ✓   |
| Create invitations             |   ✓   |        |
| Manage invitations             |   ✓   |        |
| Add or remove members          |   ✓   |        |
| Change member roles            |   ✓   |        |
| Create or delete workspaces    |   ✓   |        |
| Update organization settings   |   ✓   |        |
| Delete organization            |   ✓   |        |

An organization must always have at least one admin. You cannot demote or remove the last remaining admin.

## Invite members

Invitations are shareable tokens that allow others to join your organization. Only admins can create invitations. Each invitation expires after 7 days.

### Web app

On the organization page, scroll to the **Invitations** section. Fill in the role (admin or member) and an optional label to help you remember who the invitation is for. Click **Create** to generate the invitation.

The platform displays a token that you can copy and share with the invitee.

### CLI

```sh
tenzir-platform org invite --role=member --label="for Alice"
```

The command outputs an invitation ID and a token. Share the token with the person you want to invite.

## Accept an invitation

### Web app

Navigate to the invitation link. The page shows the organization name, the role you’ll receive, and the expiration date. Click **Accept** to join.

### CLI

```sh
tenzir-platform org redeem-invitation <token>
```

Single organization constraint

A user can only belong to one organization at a time. If you’re already a member of an organization, you must leave it before accepting a new invitation.

## View and manage invitations

Admins can view all invitations and their status.

### Web app

The **Invitations** section on the organization page lists all invitations with color-coded status badges:

* **Pending** (yellow): Not yet accepted
* **Accepted** (green): Successfully redeemed
* **Revoked** (red): Cancelled by an admin

### CLI

List all invitations:

```sh
tenzir-platform org list-invitations
```

Revoke a pending invitation:

```sh
tenzir-platform org revoke-invitation <invitation_id>
```

## Remove a member

Admins can remove any member from the organization. Members can also remove themselves (leave).

```sh
tenzir-platform org remove-member <user_id>
```

Caution

You cannot remove the last remaining member or the last remaining admin from an organization.

## Leave an organization

Any member can leave an organization voluntarily, unless they are the last member or the last admin.

```sh
tenzir-platform org leave
```
