# Run tests


This guide shows you how to run existing integration tests with the [`tenzir-test`](../../reference/test-framework.md) framework. You’ll learn how to execute the test suite, control output verbosity, select specific tests, handle flaky scenarios, and run multi-project setups.

When you’re ready to create your own tests, see the [write tests](write-tests.md) guide.

## Run the test suite

Execute all tests from the project root:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test
```

The harness discovers tests under `tests/`, runs them against their baselines, and returns a non-zero exit code when any output diverges. By default (quiet mode) the harness only shows failures, which keeps large test runs readable.

## Control output

Add `--verbose` (`-v`) to see passing and skipped tests as they complete:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test --verbose
```

Use `--debug` to see comparison targets alongside the usual harness diagnostics. Debug mode automatically enables verbose output so you see all test results. For CI-only visibility you can set `TENZIR_TEST_DEBUG=1`.

Add `--summary` together with `--verbose` when you also want the tabular breakdown and failure tree at the end:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test --verbose --summary
```

Use `--passthrough` (`-p`) to stream raw stdout/stderr to the terminal instead of comparing against baselines. This is useful during early iterations when you want to inspect command output before recording reference artifacts:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test --passthrough tests/high-severity.tql
```

## Select tests

### By path

Pass individual files or directories as positional arguments:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test tests/alerts/high-severity.tql
```

You can list multiple paths in a single invocation:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test tests/alerts tests/parsing/csv.tql
```

### By name pattern

Use `-m`/`--match` to select tests whose relative path contains a given substring:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test -m context
```

Bare strings without glob metacharacters perform a **substring match** against the test’s relative POSIX path from the project root. For example, `-m mysql` matches any test whose path contains `mysql`, such as `tests/mysql/connect.tql`. This means you no longer need to wrap the keyword in wildcards---`-m mysql` works the same as `-m '*mysql*'`.

Patterns containing `*`, `?`, or `[` still use [fnmatch](https://docs.python.org/3/library/fnmatch.html) glob syntax with case-sensitive comparison, so existing glob patterns continue to work:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test -m 'tests/*/connect.tql'
```

Multiple patterns act as an OR filter---a test runs if it matches any pattern:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test -m create -m update
```

You can combine `-m` with positional paths. The harness intersects both selections, so only tests matching both the path selection and a pattern are run. This lets you narrow a directory to a subset of its tests:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test tests/context/ -m create
```

Suite expansion

If a matched test belongs to a suite (configured via `test.yaml`), all tests in that suite are included automatically. Empty and whitespace-only patterns are silently ignored.

## Retry flaky tests

If a scenario fails intermittently, add a `retry` entry to its frontmatter so the harness reruns it before flagging a failure. The value is the **total** attempt budget:

```yaml
---
retry: 3
---
```

With `retry: 3`, the test runs up to three times. Intermediate attempts stay quiet; the final result line includes `attempts=3/3` (or the actual number on a success). Use this as a guardrail while you investigate the underlying flake and keep the budget small to avoid masking issues.

## Override skip configuration

The harness provides two levels of control for running skipped tests.

### Run all skipped tests

Pass `--run-skipped` to bypass all skip configuration unconditionally and force every skipped test to execute:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test --run-skipped
```

Both static skips (`skip: reason`) and conditional skips (`skip: {on: fixture-unavailable}`) are bypassed. This is the sledgehammer approach---useful when you want to verify that every skipped test still works.

### Filter by skip reason

Use `--run-skipped-reason` to selectively run skipped tests whose reason matches a pattern. The flag uses the same substring and glob matching semantics as `--match`:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test --run-skipped-reason maintenance
uvx tenzir-test --run-skipped-reason '*docker*'
```

Bare strings match as substrings, and patterns containing `*`, `?`, or `[` use fnmatch syntax. The match applies to the final displayed skip reason, which includes the `fixture unavailable:` prefix for conditional skips. For example, a suite with `skip: {on: fixture-unavailable, reason: requires docker}` produces the displayed reason `fixture unavailable: requires docker`, and `--run-skipped-reason docker` matches it as a substring.

The flag is repeatable---a skipped test runs if its reason matches any provided pattern:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test --run-skipped-reason maintenance --run-skipped-reason '*docker*'
```

When no skipped tests match the reason filters, the harness prints a diagnostic so you know the patterns had no effect.

### Combining both flags

When both `--run-skipped` and `--run-skipped-reason` are provided, `--run-skipped` takes precedence and all skipped tests run unconditionally.

## Run multiple projects

Large organisations often split tests across several repositories but still want an aggregated run. List additional project directories after `--root` and add `--all-projects` to execute the root alongside its satellites under a single invocation:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test --root example-project --all-projects ../example-satellite
```

The root project (`example-project` above) supplies the shared fixtures and runners. Satellites inherit those definitions, can register their own helpers, and run their tests in isolation. Because the selection only listed the satellite, `--all-projects` keeps the root in scope. The CLI prints a compact summary showing how many tests each project contributes and which runners are involved. Add `--verbose` to see individual test results as they complete, and combine it with `--summary` for the tabular breakdown and detailed failure listing after each project.

## Load packages

When your tests need packages, point `--package-dirs` at the package directories (or a parent that contains them). The flag is repeatable and supports comma-separated lists:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test --package-dirs example-library example-library
```

Here `example-library` contains multiple packages, so the harness loads them all and makes sibling packages visible for cross-imports. You can also declare package directories in a directory `test.yaml` via `package-dirs:`; those entries merge with `--package-dirs`.

## Automate runs

Once the suite passes locally, integrate it into your CI pipeline. Configure the job to install Python 3.12, install `tenzir-test`, provision or download the required Tenzir binaries, and execute `uvx tenzir-test --root .`. For reproducible results, keep your datasets small and deterministic, and prefer fixtures that wipe state between runs.
