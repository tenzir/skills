# Run fixtures


This guide shows you how to start fixtures in standalone mode without running tests. You’ll learn how to use the `--fixture` CLI option to bring up managed services, inspect their environment variables, and tear them down cleanly.

Standalone fixture mode is useful when you want to develop or debug against a service that a fixture manages (a database, message broker, HTTP server, etc.) without waiting for the full test suite.

## Prerequisites

* Install `tenzir-test` (see the [test framework](../../reference/test-framework.md) reference).
* Have a project with registered fixtures, either built-in ones like `node` or custom ones under `fixtures/`.

## Start a fixture

Pass `--fixture` with the fixture name:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test --fixture mysql
```

The harness discovers project fixtures, activates the one you requested, and blocks until you interrupt it. While it runs, it prints the environment variables the fixture exports:

```text
MYSQL_HOST=127.0.0.1
MYSQL_PORT=3306
```

You can copy these values into another terminal session or feed them to an external tool.

## Pass options to a fixture

Fixtures that declare structured options accept them through a YAML mapping spec. Append a colon and braces after the fixture name:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test --fixture 'kafka: {port: 9092}'
```

This follows the same syntax as the `fixtures:` frontmatter key in test files. Bare names use the fixture’s default options; the mapping overrides specific fields. The fixture receives the values through `current_options()`.

## Start multiple fixtures

The `--fixture` flag is repeatable:

```sh
uvx tenzir-test --fixture mysql --fixture redis
```

All requested fixtures start together. Their combined environment variables appear in the output, sorted by key.

## Combine with other flags

Several flags from the regular test path also work in fixture mode:

* `--debug` enables verbose fixture lifecycle logging so you can see startup and health-check details.
* `-k` / `--keep` preserves temporary directories after shutdown, which is helpful for inspecting state or log files that a fixture wrote.
* `--package-dirs` forwards package directories to the fixture environment so fixtures that start Tenzir nodes find the correct packages.

```sh
uvx tenzir-test --fixture node --debug --keep
```

## Shut down

Press **Ctrl+C** or send `SIGTERM` to stop. The harness tears fixtures down in reverse order, just as it does after a regular test run. Temporary directories are cleaned up unless you passed `--keep`.

Note

`--fixture` and positional TEST arguments are mutually exclusive. To run a specific test with a fixture, declare it in frontmatter or `test.yaml` instead.

## Use the built-in docker-compose fixture

When your tests need Docker Compose services such as databases or message brokers, the harness provides a built-in `docker-compose` fixture. It starts services before a test (or suite), waits for readiness, exports connection details as environment variables, and tears everything down afterwards. You do not need to write any fixture code for this workflow.

### Step 1: Create a Compose file

Place a `compose.yaml` next to your test or in the same directory as your `test.yaml`:

tests/docker-compose/compose.yaml

```yaml
services:
  redis:
    image: redis:7-alpine
    ports:
      - "6379"
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "redis-cli", "ping"]
      interval: 1s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 30
```

Publish ports without a fixed host binding (use `"6379"` instead of `"6379:6379"`) so the fixture discovers the dynamically assigned host port.

### Step 2: Configure the fixture in test.yaml

Reference the Compose file and select the services to start:

tests/docker-compose/test.yaml

```yaml
suite: docker-compose-demo
fixtures:
  - docker-compose:
      file: compose.yaml
      services: [redis]
      wait:
        timeout_seconds: 90
skip:
  on: fixture-unavailable
  reason: requires docker compose
```

The `skip` entry ensures the suite skips cleanly on machines without Docker Compose instead of failing.

### Step 3: Write a test that uses the services

The fixture exports environment variables for each service. Use them in a shell script or TQL pipeline to connect to the running containers:

tests/docker-compose/check.sh

```sh
#!/bin/sh
set -eu


: "${DOCKER_COMPOSE_PROVIDER:?}"
: "${DOCKER_COMPOSE_PROJECT_NAME:?}"
: "${DOCKER_COMPOSE_FILE:?}"
: "${DOCKER_COMPOSE_SERVICE_REDIS_CONTAINER_ID:?}"
: "${DOCKER_COMPOSE_SERVICE_REDIS_HOST:?}"
: "${DOCKER_COMPOSE_SERVICE_REDIS_PORT_6379_TCP:?}"
: "${DOCKER_COMPOSE_SERVICE_REDIS_PORT:?}"


echo "docker-compose fixture ok"
```

For a service named `redis` that publishes port 6379, the fixture sets `DOCKER_COMPOSE_SERVICE_REDIS_HOST` to `127.0.0.1` and `DOCKER_COMPOSE_SERVICE_REDIS_PORT_6379_TCP` to the dynamically assigned host port. When a service exposes exactly one port, the shorthand `DOCKER_COMPOSE_SERVICE_REDIS_PORT` is also available.

```tql
from {
  host: env("DOCKER_COMPOSE_SERVICE_REDIS_HOST"),
  port: env("DOCKER_COMPOSE_SERVICE_REDIS_PORT_6379_TCP"),
  shorthand: env("DOCKER_COMPOSE_SERVICE_REDIS_PORT"),
}
```

```tql
{
  host: "127.0.0.1",
  port: "49152", // dynamically assigned
  shorthand: "49152",
}
```

See the [test framework reference](../../reference/test-framework.md#built-in-docker-compose-fixture) for the full options reference, including all configuration fields, readiness detection behavior, and the complete list of exported environment variables.
