# Configure a node


The default node configuration is optimized for most common scenarios. But you can fine-tune the settings to match your specific requirements.

We recommend beginning with learning [how the node configuration process](../../explanations/configuration.md) works, and then browse the [example configuration](../../reference/node/configuration.md) for tuning knobs.

Here are few common configuration scenarios.

## Accept incoming connections

When your node starts it will listen for node-to-node connections on the TCP endpoint `127.0.0.1:5158`. Select a different endpoint via the `tenzir.endpoint` option. For example, to bind to an IPv6 address use `[::1]:42000`.

## Refuse incoming connections

Set `tenzir.endpoint` to `false` to disable the endpoint, making the node exclusively accessible through the Tenzir Platform. This effectively prevents connections from other `tenzir` or `tenzir-node` processes.

## Configure pipeline subprocesses

Pipelines that run in a node can be partially moved to a subprocess for improved error resilience and resource utilization. Operators that need to communicate with a component still run inside the main node process for architectural reasons. Set `tenzir.pipeline-subprocesses: true` in `tenzir.yaml` or `TENZIR_PIPELINE_SUBPROCESSES=true` on the command line to enable this feature, which is disabled by default.

Learn more about [pipeline subprocesses](../../explanations/node.md#pipeline-subprocesses) and their trade-offs.

## Route outbound traffic through an HTTP proxy

Configure `tenzir.http-proxy` and `tenzir.https-proxy` when outbound operators must reach external services through a proxy:

\<configdir>/tenzir/tenzir.yaml

```yaml
tenzir:
  http-proxy: http://proxy.example.com:3128
  https-proxy: http://proxy.example.com:3128
  no-proxy: .internal,10.0.0.0/8
```

The proxy URL must include an explicit port. Use `tenzir.no-proxy` to bypass the proxy for internal hosts or IP ranges.

See [Configuration](../../explanations/configuration.md#outbound-proxy-configuration) for the full precedence rules, environment variable fallbacks, and how proxy settings apply.

## Configure the platform TLS connection

By default, the platform connection uses TLS and picks up the settings from the `tenzir.tls` config block. To configure TLS specifically for the platform connection, see [Platform connection TLS](configure-tls.md#platform-connection-tls).
