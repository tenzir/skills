# Configure TLS

> Set up TLS encryption for operators and platform connections


Tenzir supports Transport Layer Security (TLS) for encrypting network connections. You can configure TLS settings centrally in `tenzir.yaml` so they apply to all compatible operators, or override them per-operator as needed.

## Node-level TLS configuration

Instead of passing TLS options to each operator individually, configure them once under `tenzir.tls` in your `tenzir.yaml`:

tenzir.yaml

```yaml
tenzir:
  tls:
    tls-min-version: "1.2"
    tls-ciphers: "ECDHE-ECDSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256:ECDHE-RSA-AES128-GCM-SHA256"
    cacert: "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt"
```

These settings apply automatically to operators like [`from_http`](../../reference/operators/from_http.md), [`load_tcp`](../../reference/operators/load_tcp.md), [`save_tcp`](../../reference/operators/save_tcp.md), [`to_opensearch`](../../reference/operators/to_opensearch.md), [`from_opensearch`](../../reference/operators/from_opensearch.md), [`to_splunk`](../../reference/operators/to_splunk.md), [`save_email`](../../reference/operators/save_email.md), and [`to_fluent_bit`](../../reference/operators/to_fluent_bit.md).

### Available options

| Option                   | Description                                                         |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `enable`                 | Enable TLS on all operators that support it                         |
| `skip-peer-verification` | Disable certificate verification (not recommended for production)   |
| `cacert`                 | Path to a CA certificate bundle for server verification             |
| `certfile`               | Path to a client certificate file                                   |
| `keyfile`                | Path to a client private key file                                   |
| `tls-min-version`        | Minimum TLS protocol version: `"1.0"`, `"1.1"`, `"1.2"`, or `"1.3"` |
| `tls-ciphers`            | OpenSSL cipher list string                                          |

### Precedence

Arguments passed directly to operators always take precedence over node-level settings. This lets you override specific connections when needed:

```tql
// Uses node-level TLS settings
from_http "https://api.example.com/data"


// Overrides with a custom certificate
from_http "https://internal.example.com/data", tls={cacert: "/path/to/internal-ca.crt"}
```

## Mutual TLS (mTLS)

For server-mode operators, you can require clients to present valid certificates. This enables mutual TLS authentication where both sides verify each other’s identity.

tenzir.yaml

```yaml
tenzir:
  tls:
    certfile: "/etc/tenzir/server.crt"
    keyfile: "/etc/tenzir/server.key"
    tls-client-ca: "/etc/tenzir/client-ca.crt"
    tls-require-client-cert: true
```

| Option                    | Description                                                           |
| ------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `tls-client-ca`           | Path to a CA certificate for validating client certificates           |
| `tls-require-client-cert` | Require clients to present valid certificates signed by the client CA |

When `tls-require-client-cert` is enabled, connections from clients without valid certificates are rejected.

## Platform connection TLS

When connecting a node to the Tenzir Platform, you can configure TLS settings specifically for this connection under `plugins.platform`. All options have the same semantics as the [node-level TLS config](#node-level-tls-configuration), but only apply to the node ↔ platform connection.

tenzir.yaml

```yaml
plugins:
  platform:
    enable: true
    skip-peer-verification: false
    cacert: "/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt"
    certfile: "/etc/tenzir/platform-client.crt"
    keyfile: "/etc/tenzir/platform-client.key"
    tls-min-version: "1.2"
    tls-ciphers: "HIGH:!aNULL:!MD5"
    tls-client-ca: "/etc/tenzir/platform-ca.crt"
    tls-require-client-cert: false
```

Any option specified here overrides the corresponding node-level `tenzir.tls` setting.

## Generate test certificates

For testing purposes, generate a certificate from a local CA:

```bash
uv run --with trustme python -m trustme
```

Caution

Don’t use self-signed certificates in production. Obtain certificates from a trusted certificate authority instead.

## Verify TLS connections

Test a TLS connection using OpenSSL:

```bash
openssl s_client -connect 127.0.0.1:443
```

This shows the certificate chain and connection details, helping you diagnose TLS configuration issues.
