# Packages


This page explains how packages bundle pipelines, operators, contexts, and examples into a deployable unit. You’ll learn about package design principles and how the components fit together.

## What is a package

A **package** is a 1-click deployable unit that implements a specific use case. Packages provide a modular way to distribute TQL functionality, from simple transformations to complete data processing workflows.

Packages solve common distribution challenges:

* **Reusability**: Share operators and pipelines across teams and projects
* **Configurability**: Template inputs let users customize behavior without modifying source files
* **Testability**: The Test Framework validates package behavior
* **Discoverability**: The Tenzir Library makes packages findable and installable

## Package structure

A package is a directory with the following structure:

* pkg/

  * changelog/ User-facing trail of changes

    * …

  * examples/ Self-contained snippets to run

    * …

  * operators/ User-defined operators (UDOs)

    * …

  * pipelines/ Fully deployable pipelines

    * …

  * tests/ Integration tests

    * inputs/ Sample data for tests

      * …

  * package.yaml Package manifest

The `package.yaml` manifest is the only required file. It identifies the directory as a package and contains metadata, context definitions, and input specifications.

## Package components

### Operators

**User-defined operators (UDOs)** in the `operators` directory provide reusable building blocks. Tenzir names them using the convention `<package>::[dirs...]::<basename>`.

Operators can accept [positional and named arguments](../guides/packages/add-operators.md#add-parameters-to-operators) for flexible, parameterized transformations.

### Pipelines

**Pipelines** in the `pipelines` directory are complete, deployable TQL programs. Unlike operators, pipelines must have both input and output operators. They run automatically when you install the package (unless disabled).

Pipeline [frontmatter options](../guides/packages/add-pipelines.md#configure-pipeline-behavior) control restart behavior, enable/disable state, and other runtime settings.

### Contexts

**Contexts** defined in the manifest provide stateful enrichment capabilities. The node creates these contexts when you install the package, making them available for lookup and enrichment operations.

### Examples

**Examples** in the `examples` directory demonstrate how to use the package. These self-contained snippets appear in the Tenzir Library and help users understand package capabilities.

### Tests

**Tests** in the `tests` directory validate package behavior using the Test Framework. Tests ensure operators and pipelines work correctly and provide confidence during package updates.

### Changelog

The **changelog** directory tracks user-facing changes using the Ship Framework. It helps users understand what changed between versions and guides upgrade decisions.

## Design principles

### Composability

Good packages expose **operators** as building blocks that users can compose in their own pipelines. This maximizes flexibility: users decide when and how to invoke the functionality.

### Opt-in execution

Packages that include **pipelines** execute immediately upon installation. For maximum flexibility, ship pipelines with `disabled: true` so users can review and enable them explicitly.

### Configurability

Use **inputs** to parameterize packages instead of hardcoding values. This allows the same package to work across different environments without modification.

### Testability

Write tests for operators and contexts early. The Test Framework makes testing straightforward, and good test coverage enables confident iteration.

## Package lifecycle

1. **Create**: Set up the package structure and manifest
2. **Develop**: Add operators, pipelines, contexts, and examples
3. **Test**: Validate behavior with the Test Framework
4. **Install**: Deploy locally or through the Tenzir Library
5. **Maintain**: Update the changelog and publish releases
