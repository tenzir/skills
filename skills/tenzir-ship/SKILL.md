# tenzir-ship

This skill bundles key release engineering use cases with tenzir-ship.

## Use Cases

### Add a changelog entry

Add changelog entries as part of shipping bugfixes, changes, and features during
day-to-day development.

Instructions: `references/add-changelog-entry.md`

### Create a release

We distinguish two types of releases:

1. [Remote](references/create-remote-release.md): triggers a CI workflow
2. [Local](references/create-local-release.md): releases from a local repository

Prefer a remote release if a workflow exists, and use a local release otherwise.
